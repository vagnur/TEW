The Skinny,70,"If the burden on electronic producers is to establish personality beyond a dense network of light displays and computer processing, this album gets Flume halfway there: It shows him as unquestionably human (overeager, alternately flashy and timid, sometimes more in awe than in control), but still a bit faceless.","Oct 28, 2016"

AllMusic,100,"This is her second visual album, and Lemonade is best served with the visuals, a semi-autobiographical film with deft dream-logic, a Purple Rain for the internet age.

Slant Magazine,80,"In a year when the worlds biggest artists have put their necks on the line--Rihannas leave-me-alone, independent streak of Anti, Kanye Wests scatterbrained ever-changing doodle The Life of Pablo--Beyonc can count herself as a risk-taker breaking new ground, up there with the bravest.","Oct  7, 2016"

Los Angeles Times,80,"Lemonade is strikingly varied. ... Where her huge team fails to innovate is on the albums drab middle few cuts about acceptance and forgiveness--chief among them the horrible hoedown Daddy Lessons, which blends whooping with boring rhymes (Daddy made me fight / It wasn't always right).

Magnet,80,"The difference is that those albums [Anti and The Life Of Pablo] were at best a bold and intriguing mess: the sense that the artists behind them were having trouble marshalling their ideas was hard to escape. Lemonade, however, feels like a success, made by someone very much in control.","Oct  7, 2016"
Uncut,70,"The cathartic and wounded moments here resonate in a manner matched by few, if any, of Beyonc's contemporaries. She sometimes eclipses herself in terms of raw emotion, as on the throttling Jack White encounter 'Don't Hurt Yourself.' At the low-volume end, there's more power in the few seconds she chokes back tears while singing 'Come back'--timed with the backing vocal in Isaac Hayes' version of 'Walk on By'--than there is in most contemporary ballads.","Oct  7, 2016"
PopMatters,70,"If Lemonade feels less ambitious than the near-70-minute Beyonc, it's probably because the penetrating spoken-word interludes, composed of verses by Somali-British poet Warsan Shire, featured in Lemonade's accompanying long-form music video have been excised from the album itself.","Oct  7, 2016"

Los Angeles Times,50,"Honey, when it works at least, is the sound of piecing together the night before: a love letter to not making it home, to the Tequila salt still stuck to your hand, to hands brushing under the cover of the smoke machine.

It works less well on cuts like Kehlani collaboration 'Wrong,' which is gratingly heavy-handed with the Auto Tune--a problem that again rears its whiny head on 'Fool for You.'","May 27, 2016"
musicOMH.com,60,"He stumbles with tepid ballads like 'It's You' and 'Blue,' but the record is saved by its more experimental moments--specifically, the warm, neo-soul track 'Truth' and hypnotic Persian-infused intermission 'Flower.'","May 27, 2016"

New Musical Express (NME),70,"Slay-Z is a solid EP that is also incredibly frustrating. It's frustrating because it is an example of the talent that Banks is wasting by devoting so much of her time and energy to having pissing contests on social media.","May 27, 2016"
The Guardian,70,"Her outrageous self-possession plays out more vibrantly on some of these tracks, like Big Talk, which puts her up against the rapper Rick Ross, and Riot, which has a klaxon-like hook handled by Nina Sky. Theres no end to Ms. Bankss swagger, though her toughest moments veer toward the style of a hometown rival, Nicki Minaj.","May 27, 2016"

AllMusic,80,"If these Top 40 fixtures make the album feel in keeping with current radio pop, they don't crowd Stefani with unnecessary bells and whistles. Her singing--and, more important, what her singing is saying--is always front and center, which gives the music an intimate quality even at its most polished.","May 13, 2016"
No Ripcord,70,"Its easy to chastise aging pop stars for chasing trends or trying to recapture past glories, but those efforts here are thrown into sharp relief by the maturity of the albums first half.","May 13, 2016"

The New York Times,60,"Over the albums 12 tracks, Stefani doesnt mope once--in fact, a lot of the time she sounds like she doesnt give a s**t. Where Would I Be and Send Me A Picture say it with Disney dancehall, while Me Without You is the closest she comes to balladry, singing I dont need you/not a little bit over polished trip-hop.","May 13, 2016"
AllMusic,60,"The album has a rushed feel--a likable but low-personality version of her familiar bubble-pop solo mode, alternating between miffed breakup plaints (the Amy Winehouse tribute 'Naughty') and gushy new-boyfriend songs.","May 13, 2016"
Rolling Stone,60,"When she gets heavy with either beats or ballads, This Is What The Truth Feels Like slows to a crawl. Cut away these excesses--these moments of emotional bloodletting or thirsty appeals to the top of the charts--and This Is What The Truth Feels Like manages to be as fleet, giddy and charming as Gwen Stefani ever is.","May 13, 2016"
Boston Globe,59,"Stefanis focus on the good times alternates with songs where she expresses cartoonish anger by awkwardly rapping and shouting non-sequiturs (Naughty, Red Flag), and neither mode plays to her strengths as a songwriter and signature vocalist. Her best songs are the ones in which she is audibly upset.","May 13, 2016"
The Guardian,50,"This Is What the Truth Feels Like is half-baked in places and perhaps a little too safe in others, but its really, properly genuine, and if she doesnt leave it a decade next time, Stefani might still be able to make a great pop record. Its in there, somewhere.","May 13, 2016"
Entertainment Weekly,50,"The pop-rock of the albums first half is relaxed, breezy, intimate, and dull; the twitching beatscapes of its back end are tense, fiery, theatrical, and void.","May 13, 2016"

Boston Globe,80,"Thanks to the remarkable instrument that is Furler's voice: huge but fragile, fearlessly ragged and wild, seemingly a conduit of a tumultuous past that has included drug addiction and mental health issues, it perfectly counterpoints her songs' robust construction in a way that makes you wish she kept every song she wrote for herself.","Apr 23, 2016"
Slant Magazine,70,"Every track is a potential hit, and Sias use of pure pop hooks, coupled with an astounding control over her rampant voice, makes this a very good record.","Apr 23, 2016"
New Musical Express (NME),70,"Given that Furler didn't originally plan to make these songs her own, it's impressive that This Is Acting works as well as it does--only the wannabe banger 'Move Your Body' and 'Sweet Design''s flashy, hard-hitting R&B are truly unconvincing.

RapReviews.com,68,"It's a complete piece of work, and one that serves as a commentary on the intersectionality of art and fame by someone who has recently acquired a new level of notoriety.

Los Angeles Times,60,"This Is Acting, for all its backstory, rousing highlights, and questionable stylistic choices, actually feels like more of a placeholder than it was probably intended to be, continuing on the radio-ready success of 1000 Forms of Fear but doing very little to push her craft forward outside of exciting productions like Move Your Body and emotional breakthroughs like Space Between.","Apr 23, 2016"

The Independent (UK),70,"If the burden on electronic producers is to establish personality beyond a dense network of light displays and computer processing, this album gets Flume halfway there: It shows him as unquestionably human (overeager, alternately flashy and timid, sometimes more in awe than in control), but still a bit faceless.","Oct 16, 2015"

The Observer (UK),60,"Not every guest spot works--Lauper's idiosyncrasies don't quite mesh with Alison Krauss's pristine bluegrass harmonies on Dolly Parton's 'Hard Candy Christmas.'

AllMusic,60,"On a track-by-track level, Detour has a few stumbles--the biggest is 'Night Life,' and that's due to the gravelly growl of Willie Nelson, not Lauper--and if it's taken as a collection of performances and not a coherent record, it's fun.","Sep 11, 2015"

The Guardian,100,"This is her second visual album, and Lemonade is best served with the visuals, a semi-autobiographical film with deft dream-logic, a Purple Rain for the internet age.

Sputnikmusic,85,"Lemonade is a stunning album, one that sees her exploring sounds she never has before. It also voices a rarely seen concept, that of the album-length ode to infidelity. Even stranger, it doesnt double as an album-length ode to breaking up.","Aug 28, 2015"

Where her huge team fails to innovate is on the albums drab middle few cuts about acceptance and forgiveness--chief among them the horrible hoedown Daddy Lessons, which blends whooping with boring rhymes (Daddy made me fight / It wasn't always right).

Rolling Stone,80,"The difference is that those albums [Anti and The Life Of Pablo] were at best a bold and intriguing mess: the sense that the artists behind them were having trouble marshalling their ideas was hard to escape. Lemonade, however, feels like a success, made by someone very much in control.","Aug 28, 2015"
Spin,70,"The cathartic and wounded moments here resonate in a manner matched by few, if any, of Beyonc's contemporaries. She sometimes eclipses herself in terms of raw emotion, as on the throttling Jack White encounter 'Don't Hurt Yourself.' At the low-volume end, there's more power in the few seconds she chokes back tears while singing 'Come back'--timed with the backing vocal in Isaac Hayes' version of 'Walk on By'--than there is in most contemporary ballads.","Aug 28, 2015"
NOW Magazine,70,"If Lemonade feels less ambitious than the near-70-minute Beyonc, it's probably because the penetrating spoken-word interludes, composed of verses by Somali-British poet Warsan Shire, featured in Lemonade's accompanying long-form music video have been excised from the album itself.","Aug 28, 2015"

NOW Magazine,72,"Honey lacks the coherence of her previous albums, but as a love letter to the rave it's eloquent and sincere.","Aug 21, 2015"
Exclaim,70,"Its an exemplar of her adaptability, and in a music realm stacked with mind-numbing, homogeneous house numbers, Katy B still occupies a lane of her own.","Aug 21, 2015"
Entertainment Weekly,70,"Where Little Red saw Katy throwing herself into the occasional ballad, Honey is reduced to a pure set of dance music; within these aesthetic limits, though, it may be her most varied record stylistically.","Aug 21, 2015"
Pitchfork,70,"Katy B has a way to go in separating herself from the influx of R&B singers who dabble in dub, but shes beginning to pave a path worth following.","Aug 21, 2015"
AllMusic,70,"Its the spirit of community that defines Honey, a doting mixtape that cherishes the one thing that matters most to Katy B: club culture. From making it past the door to after-hours rejections, Briens narrative thrives musically upon teamwork.","Aug 21, 2015"
The Line of Best Fit,60,"Honey suffers when its producers smooth out their rougher edges to accommodate Katys chart-star status.","Aug 21, 2015"
New Musical Express (NME),60,"The narrative she introduced with her first single Katy on a Mission--the story of a prospective dancefloor tryst--still dominates, and its a subject that barely contains the emotional mileage to sustain a single song, let alone a whole body of work. Her vocal melodies, meanwhile, can feel almost abrasive in their mediocrity. Instead, its left to the production to provide the wit, amusement and emotion.","Aug 21, 2015"

AllMusic,50,"If it were not for Katy's distinctive voice--which she gloriously wields with an Aguilera-like ferocity during the last forty seconds or so of each track--Honey would not survive its own sweetness. At certain moments, however, the energies between Katy and the producers mesh just right, resulting in alchemic varieties of urban pop that glow brighter after each listen.","Aug 21, 2015"
Billboard.com,50,"Honey, when it works at least, is the sound of piecing together the night before: a love letter to not making it home, to the Tequila salt still stuck to your hand, to hands brushing under the cover of the smoke machine. Unfortunately, half of the time, it says precisely nothing and if that unquestionable potential is to be realised, Kathleen Brien has to make a choice.","Aug 21, 2015"

The Observer (UK),80,"That the sound hes chosen--clipped beats, hazy production flourishes, oodles of falsetto as a shortcut for emotional honesty--is basically 2016 writ large may seem bandwagon-jumping, but theres more than enough good stuff here to suggest its been created with love rather than with an eye on ticking boxes.","Jul 24, 2015"
DIY Magazine,70,"A moody, deeply textured R&B album with vibe to spare, Mind of Mine sounds as if it was designed to showcase the effort and inspiration that went into it.... With 18 tracks on the deluxe edition, the album can wear you down with all its finely wrought sophistication, even when Zayn is singing about taking your clothes off.","Jul 24, 2015"
AllMusic,67,"Mind Of Mine is a better whole than a collection of songs, and the standouts tend to be the shorter, less unambitious ditties (the theatrical Its You; the gut-punch party jam She).","Jul 24, 2015"

Q Magazine,60,"Its not a step forward, really, its a step to the side. There are still hints of the pop star Zayn was drowning out the RnB icon he wants to become.","Jul 24, 2015"
Clash Music,60,"As debut offerings often go, theres a fervent desire on Mind of Mine to stretch so far and wide that the cohesiveness of the record is lumbered as a result. The tracklist could have been refined to ten good tracks (most of which are on the bonus edition).","Jul 24, 2015"
Slant Magazine,60,"His songs get to where they need to go, but theyre lacking in narrative, specificity... purpose, if you will.","Jul 24, 2015"
Consequence of Sound,60,"Mind Of Mine is an impressive enough debut, with excellent, laidback production and assured vocals.

musicOMH.com,60,"For all its inevitable ubiquity, this downbeat, low-lit album has the bonus of not being in your face at all.","Jul 24, 2015"
The Observer (UK),60,"In some ways, it works; the songs on Mind of Mine certainly skew towards more mature content and a sleeker, less bubblegum-y pop sound that's implemented expertly by producer Malay on silky smooth PBR&B-lite ballads like 'It's You.' It works less well on cuts like Kehlani collaboration 'Wrong,' which is gratingly heavy-handed with the Auto Tune--a problem that again rears its whiny head on 'Fool for You.'","Jul 24, 2015"
DIY Magazine,60,"He stumbles with tepid ballads like 'It's You' and 'Blue,' but the record is saved by its more experimental moments--specifically, the warm, neo-soul track 'Truth' and hypnotic Persian-infused intermission 'Flower.'","Jul 24, 2015"
Uncut,59,"Lacking compelling hooks, a unifying mood, or a clear narrative, his debut is oddly inflexible and over-calculated.","Jul 24, 2015"
Under The Radar,50,"His aim to dive fully into a nuanced direction is a good look, and even though it can be too much at times, his earnestness is a natural antidote to the sleazy misanthropic attitudes of Bieber or The Weeknd. Theres just not enough focus, and promise can only take one so far without differentiation from the artists youre emulating.","Jul 24, 2015"
Drowned In Sound,50,"Zayn sounds tentative when hes venturing into lyrical territory beyond his former bands purview, which compromises the albums clearly wide-ranging aims.","Jul 24, 2015"
The Guardian,50,"The lyrics throughout Mind of Mine are similarly by-the-numbers pop-R&B: pleasure-obsessed, vaguely misogynist, and largely disposable. By the album's midpoint, Malik's playboy shtick starts to outstay its welcome.","Jul 24, 2015"

Boston Globe,70,"Slay-Z is a solid EP that is also incredibly frustrating. It's frustrating because it is an example of the talent that Banks is wasting by devoting so much of her time and energy to having pissing contests on social media.","Jul 17, 2015"
New York Daily News (Jim Faber),70,"Her outrageous self-possession plays out more vibrantly on some of these tracks, like Big Talk, which puts her up against the rapper Rick Ross, and Riot, which has a klaxon-like hook handled by Nina Sky. Theres no end to Ms. Bankss swagger, though her toughest moments veer toward the style of a hometown rival, Nicki Minaj.","Jul 17, 2015"
The Guardian,70,"Slay-Z is a very good mini-mixtape, and more than half of it sustains in any formation.","Jul 17, 2015"

Rolling Stone,80,"If these Top 40 fixtures make the album feel in keeping with current radio pop, they don't crowd Stefani with unnecessary bells and whistles. Her singing--and, more important, what her singing is saying--is always front and center, which gives the music an intimate quality even at its most polished.","Jul 10, 2015"
New York Daily News (Jim Faber),70,"Its easy to chastise aging pop stars for chasing trends or trying to recapture past glories, but those efforts here are thrown into sharp relief by the maturity of the albums first half.","Jul 10, 2015"
The Guardian,60,"The over-sauced, finger-wagging Naughty might take the joyful retribution to far in the panto direction but I Will Survive update Me Without You and joyful dancefloor rebirth Rare prove that Stefani has lost none of her pop spirit. [Jun 2016, p.117]","Jul 10, 2015"

AllMusic,60,"A little more courage would not have gone amiss.","Jul 10, 2015"
Rolling Stone,60,"Over the albums 12 tracks, Stefani doesnt mope once--in fact, a lot of the time she sounds like she doesnt give a s**t. Where Would I Be and Send Me A Picture say it with Disney dancehall, while Me Without You is the closest she comes to balladry, singing I dont need you/not a little bit over polished trip-hop.","Jul 10, 2015"
PopMatters,60,"The album has a rushed feel--a likable but low-personality version of her familiar bubble-pop solo mode, alternating between miffed breakup plaints (the Amy Winehouse tribute 'Naughty') and gushy new-boyfriend songs.","Jul 10, 2015"
Billboard.com,60,"When she gets heavy with either beats or ballads, This Is What The Truth Feels Like slows to a crawl. Cut away these excesses--these moments of emotional bloodletting or thirsty appeals to the top of the charts--and This Is What The Truth Feels Like manages to be as fleet, giddy and charming as Gwen Stefani ever is.","Jul 10, 2015"
Absolute Punk (Staff reviews),59,"Stefanis focus on the good times alternates with songs where she expresses cartoonish anger by awkwardly rapping and shouting non-sequiturs (Naughty, Red Flag), and neither mode plays to her strengths as a songwriter and signature vocalist. Her best songs are the ones in which she is audibly upset.","Jul 10, 2015"
Pitchfork,50,"This Is What the Truth Feels Like is half-baked in places and perhaps a little too safe in others, but its really, properly genuine, and if she doesnt leave it a decade next time, Stefani might still be able to make a great pop record. Its in there, somewhere.","Jul 10, 2015"
The A.V. Club,50,"The pop-rock of the albums first half is relaxed, breezy, intimate, and dull; the twitching beatscapes of its back end are tense, fiery, theatrical, and void.","Jul 10, 2015"

New Musical Express (NME),80,"Thanks to the remarkable instrument that is Furler's voice: huge but fragile, fearlessly ragged and wild, seemingly a conduit of a tumultuous past that has included drug addiction and mental health issues, it perfectly counterpoints her songs' robust construction in a way that makes you wish she kept every song she wrote for herself.","May  4, 2015"
Austin Chronicle,70,"Every track is a potential hit, and Sias use of pure pop hooks, coupled with an astounding control over her rampant voice, makes this a very good record.","May  4, 2015"
Pitchfork,70,"Given that Furler didn't originally plan to make these songs her own, it's impressive that This Is Acting works as well as it does--only the wannabe banger 'Move Your Body' and 'Sweet Design''s flashy, hard-hitting R&B are truly unconvincing. For the most part, however, This Is Acting's meta-pop is another example of how cleverly Sia brings her her experiments into the mainstream.","May  4, 2015"

Chicago Tribune,70,"Some of the tracks, like the first few ballads, feel a tad exhausted and perhaps a little clichd, but that's the nature of Sia's universal, inclusive pop music, and on This is Acting, she approaches it in an intriguing way and performs it with gusto.","May  4, 2015"
PopMatters,68,"It's a complete piece of work, and one that serves as a commentary on the intersectionality of art and fame by someone who has recently acquired a new level of notoriety.

AllMusic,60,"This Is Acting, for all its backstory, rousing highlights, and questionable stylistic choices, actually feels like more of a placeholder than it was probably intended to be, continuing on the radio-ready success of 1000 Forms of Fear but doing very little to push her craft forward outside of exciting productions like Move Your Body and emotional breakthroughs like Space Between.","May  4, 2015"

Rolling Stone,50,"There are only so many times you can key into someones heart before they change the code, and after about 20 listens, the veneer crumbles a bit, and its a little too easy to see the gears turning underneath.

Kerrang!,60,"Wildfire is the work of a determined singer/songwriter who prizes craft over poetry or introspection.

Billboard.com,40,"Efficient in conjuring intense emotion, the album has the hallmarks of a temporary success, but Plattens identity gets lost.

New Musical Express (NME),80,"He has cultivated an allure and a presence by, paradoxically, remaining extremely quiet for long-periods of time.

NOW Magazine,80,"The slow roll-out of singles over the past few months leading up to its release makes Product hard to consider as a singular cohesive package, but as a primer on SOPHIE, it's as good as it gets, a snapshot of an exciting artist whose tightrope walk between sweet and scary, pop and avant-garde, has yielded some of the best singles of the past few years.","Mar 24, 2015"

Rolling Stone,67,"Though Product is billed as a singles collection, its sequencing matters like an album; the tracks placement lets it bow under the weight of all the bizarre moments that precede it, leaving gashes too deep for it to be as treacly and plasticine as its title might suggest.","Mar 24, 2015"
AllMusic,66,"Heard as individually and spaced many months apart, the best tracks here were diamond-hard realizations of very specific sonic ideas; placed on an album alongside songs that use similar ingredients but are markedly inferior, they rattle around in the can, perfect objects in search of the right container.","Mar 24, 2015"
The Telegraph (UK),60,"Of the four new tracks, Just Like We Never Said Goodbye is the pick, evoking a John Hughes school disco scene soundtracked by Aphex Twin, though anyone feeling  the package still lacks substance can select the full 'Silicon' option at Sophie's webstore. [Feb 2016, p.118]","Mar 24, 2015"
Mojo,40,"Curiously, the tracks that smugly seem to be going out of their way to get on your nerves arent the most infuriating thing about Product. The stuff detailed above makes up the rump of the album, but its not the whole story. There are a handful of instrumentals, which, if not terribly substantial, are at least intriguing.","Mar 24, 2015"

The Observer (UK),80,"It sure doesn't sound like a band that's hanging it up, because all four are on a roll musically, chasing the rock vibe of Midnight Memories and Four.","Feb 24, 2015"
PopMatters,80,"With these 13 tracks--nine of which the band had a hand in writing--One Direction does maturity much better than on its last album, 2014's ballad-heavy Four.","Feb 24, 2015"
Rolling Stone,80,"A slight tone of weariness may have crept into 1Ds lyrics with songs about break-ups and yearning for home but musically it remains anthemic, up-tempo, superior pop, with elegant song structure, ear worm hooks and radio busting choruses.","Feb 24, 2015"
AllMusic,75,"Another deft collection of shiny, hermetically sealed anthems.","Feb 24, 2015"
Boston Globe,70,"Their songwriting shows growth, their vocals remain flawless, the production team continues to throw the occasional curveball to go along with the softballs, and there are plenty of songs that sound like the best pop music has to offer in 2015.","Feb 24, 2015"

Los Angeles Times,40,"Made In The AM doesnt really change anything for One Direction; it's simply another slick set of pop songs designed to strike a chord with their teenage fanbase and win over a few older fans along the way.","Feb 24, 2015"
Rolling Stone,40,"Made in the A.M. is much the same, rootless and vague even when it lands on a clear style, like the Coldplay-esque Infinity, or Never Enough, a wacky number with intense a cappella gimmickry and exuberant mid-1980s drums and horns that recall, of all things, Huey Lewis and the News.... The music is too banal to support exceptional singing.","Feb 24, 2015"

DJ Booth,83,"Biebers sound is much more deliberately of the moment: a skittering, metallic synthesis of dance music and modern R&B whose evolution probably owes a lot to new-school collaborators Diplo and Skrillex, as well as the lesser-known production wizard Poo Bear.","Jan 13, 2015"
AllMusic,80,"It looks to be a strong move in his transition to adulthood and proves there's far more to him than being a pretty face for schoolgirls to swoon over.","Jan 13, 2015"
Billboard.com,80,"Despite its countless co-writers and producers, chief among them Biebers bestie Jason Poo Bear Boyd, the album boasts a consistent palette of lush, low-key electro-dance sounds: sun-warped synths, chipmunk accent vocals, rattling trap hi-hats, and loads of bass.... Its in this Spotify-age blend of dance, hip-hop, R&B and classic smooth-dude vocalizing that Bieber truly shows his growth.","Jan 13, 2015"
Exclaim,80,"Biebers offering is less of a mainstream crowd pleaser and all the more interesting for it, a quirky, atmospheric electro RnB concoction with sci-fi sounds and offbeat vocal samples that focus attention on the stars soft, supple and seductive singing.","Jan 13, 2015"

Fact Magazine (UK),70,"By giving us the best album of his career, and subsequently re-ascending to Top 40s mountaintop, Biebers answered his own question: In pop music, its never too late to say youre sorry.","Jan 13, 2015"

Pitchfork,60,"If Purpose focused on the excursions into global dance sounds that earned him popularity outside the insular Belieber fandom, it might have been one of the best pop records of the year and alleviated some of the headaches induced by his lyrical persona. It certainly doesn't help that Purpose is another entry in an ever growing catalog of big tent releases that relegates some of its best tracks to bonus track status.","Jan 13, 2015"
The A.V. Club,60,"A bumpy, oddly compelling restart, Purpose should hook open-minded pop fans who previously paid him no mind, and it could even win back some of those who wrote Bieber off years ago.","Jan 13, 2015"
Los Angeles Times,60,"The lead-up to Purpose produced three unexpectedly great beats, for Where Are  Now, Sorry and What Do You Mean? respectively. Just as unexpectedly, there are even more where these came from.","Jan 13, 2015"

DJ Booth,60,"Its clear plenty of good choices have been made here. Its not quite redemption--only time will tell if hell curb the recklessness--but its certainly a start at reinvention.","Jan 13, 2015"
Slant Magazine,50,"You cant hear The Feeling in his voice, which is still one of the most infectiously beautiful in the industry, because as his faith has saved him from his pain, his production team has saved his voice from Justin. It makes for a series of unbeatable mainstream and crossover singles, and a desensitized, unnerving album.","Jan 13, 2015"
Absolute Punk (Staff reviews),50,"The album also takes itself so seriously that too often it inadvertently suppresses exactly what made Bieber so appealing in the first place.","Jan 13, 2015"
Consequence of Sound,50,"Even though Mr. Bieber is younger than all of the men of One Direction, he sounds exponentially more experienced, and exponentially more fatigued on Purpose. He is also the best singer of the bunch, and the one with a clear vision for his sound, even if hes being largely denied it here.","Jan 13, 2015"
NOW Magazine,33,"Skrillex and Diplo successfully serve up twitchy beats ready to incite anything with a pulse, but the sentiment at the albums core leans toward insufferable.","Jan 13, 2015"

RapReviews.com,60,"Melodramatic ballads like 'Secret Love Song' and 'Love Me Or Leave Me' aren't as entertaining, but they're outweighed by the sassy kiss-offs of 'Hair' ('He was just a dick and I knew it') and 'Grown' ('Your voice dropped and you thought you could handle me').","Dec 15, 2014"

Q Magazine,67,"Overall, 5 Seconds Of Summer puts a contemporary spin on early-00s mainstream pop-punk by avoiding the kind of self-pity, hopelessness, and subtle misogyny that sometimes dogged that nascent scene.

Record Collector,60,"5SOS finds a balance in their sound here that feels right for them, and ultimately the accurately titled Sounds Good Feels Good suggests there isnt actually all that big of a gap between the boy band and pop-punk milieus, and probably never was.","Nov 24, 2014"

New York Daily News (Jim Faber),60,"The album frequently slips back into forgettable genericism, and its back half is mediocre--but its also a strength.

The New York Times,72,"What Love Is Free does so well, and so simply, is hone in on just the beauty of finally letting go, physically and mentally.","Sep 30, 2014"
Sputnikmusic,70,"While the EP is a little more straightforward than Do It Again, it's a fun, spontaneous portrait of a moment made all the more poignant due to Falk's death from pancreatic cancer in 2014.","Sep 30, 2014"
Slant Magazine,70,"Love Is Free sits strangely in the canon of Robyn. Its euphoric, and like every great Robyn anthem, theres a cry-while-you-party type sound on the mini-LP thats intensely emotional but wields an undeniable kinetic streak.","Sep 30, 2014"
AllMusic,70,"The record works as just five songs.","Sep 30, 2014"

Billboard.com,80,"Slick guest artists Tyga and Kid Ink help the listener bridge the gap between the album's maverick moments and the sweet songs aimed at teens, and with smooth-voiced Royce showing equal grace with love and lust, Double Vision becomes the great and infectious model for a 2015 pan-global pop album.","Sep 16, 2014"

The A.V. Club,50,"The only reasonable offering on 'How Does It Feel' is the multi-layered and kaleidoscopic lead single, 'Painted'. Elsewhere, it's the kind of standard by-the-numbers electro-pop that's likely to soundtrack your next visit to the local department store.","Sep 16, 2014"
HipHopDX,50,"Disappointingly, How Does It Feel has a good dose of the latter [blatant variety of compositions].","Sep 16, 2014"

Slant Magazine,42,"Secondhand Rapture was inconsistent and uneven at points, but it also drew some power from its unpredictability. Its successor is twelve straight tracks of mostly the same thing: worn pop clichs. This dullness plagues the album from start to finish despite Plapingers best attempts at shouting through the monotony.","Sep 16, 2014"

PopMatters,70,"A more sonically focused effort.","Sep 16, 2014"

Boston Globe,80,"Occasionally, the more ambitious nature of Everything Is 4 reveals some of Derulo's weaknesses, like his insistence on indulging straight R&B (which feels basic compared to the unique mode of genre-bending he usually works in), but stretching musically also leads to arguably the most exciting moment here, the funk rave-up of album-closer 'X2CU.'","Jul 22, 2014"

The Observer (UK),75,"The PinkPrint is the closest Nicki Minaj has ever gotten to balancing her tendencies, and the furthest shes ever been from emotional stability.","Mar 18, 2014"
DIY Magazine,75,"If the late-add dance track confuses things, it's hard to fault Minaj. Throughout The Pinkprint, she's intent on channeling her talent to explore and document her many moods. The combination is often, if not always, intoxicating.","Mar 18, 2014"
The Guardian,70,"Tracking and self-editing issues have always plagued her Minajesty's projects, but never more so than on this one, an album that probably would've landed with bigger fanfare had Minaj not so loudly touted it as all but an instant classic all year long.","Mar 18, 2014"
Sputnikmusic,70,"There's frankly very little chance I'd ever listen to this album again if I wasn't obligated to revisit it in a month via '1 Listen' rules, but Nicki's got her own lane and it's not a lane I'm going to roadblock.","Mar 18, 2014"
Consequence of Sound,70,"This is a big step forward for the genre, and makes one wish that Minaj's content could be as good as her form, that more attention was paid to crafting complex rhymes and less on floating through halfway conceived tracks in a sing-song burble. Yet even if she hasn't fully nailed the balance between her different modes, at least Minaj is doing something challenging, offering a third different approach on her third album.","Mar 18, 2014"
Pitchfork,68,"An understandable desire to have her traumas understood by everybody inevitably results in a bland mush of melodrama. Despite this, The Pinkprint is Nicki Minajs most successful album by a fairly wide margin, as she becomes more empathetic than at any point in the past while Pink Fridays DMZ between pop and rap becomes little more than a historical footnote in her career.","Mar 18, 2014"
Clash Music,67,"If The Pinkprint is a letdown compared to The Blueprint, then Minaj brought it on herself.

NOW Magazine,67,"[On album's first half] the melodies are sturdy and the lyrics catch. Later, the titles get sillier (''Stockholm Syndrome''), and the guitar-jam vibe turns as dull as every real-life guitar jam. But when Four ends, your ears are guilt-free.","Feb  4, 2014"

Rolling Stone,50,"The album's irresistibly obvious choruses, hackneyed sentiments, and puppy-eyed earnestness can come off as endearing when the songwriting is clever enough, but every misstep is, despite the band's efforts to assert more control over their music, a painful reminder of One Direction's status as a manufactured, focus-grouped pop entity.","Feb  4, 2014"
Clash Music,42,"Whats unfortunate is that songs the group co-wrote are the weakest ones here.

PopMatters,40,"After an Our Version of Events-worthy build, its crying out for something slightly off-kilter to douse the saccharine overload, but instead shoots for a bounding chorus of Rather Be-proportions, which misses in favour of something that can only be described as 90s dance clunk.","Jul  9, 2013"
AllMusic,40,"The lyrics are uniformly awful.","Jul  9, 2013"
Fact Magazine (UK),30,"The classical elements are independently pleasing--as youd expect when elements of Shostakovich, Mozart and so on are used--but by drenching it all in commercial dance production, the supposed fusion becomes a bastardisation.","Jul  9, 2013"

PopMatters,60,"The album features more guest rappers than even her 2002 remix album, and the standout 'Acting Like That,' featuring the always reliable Iggy Azalea, is handily the hardest beat she's ever bought. Unfortunately, A.K.A. also includes a slew of midtempo ballads whose soaring hooks and slick production are wasted on Lopez's reedy voice.","Jul  9, 2013"

Q Magazine,25,"The songwriting is lazy ('I feel good,' she coos, ''cause I don't feel bad.' Logic!). The double entendres don't make sense (is 'Troubeaux' what they call trouble in Bordeaux?). And the guest stars, including Nas, Rick Ross, and Iggy Azalea, are so much more engaging than their hostess that Lopez sounds like she's been relegated to playing the hook girl on her own album.","Jul  9, 2013"

Exclaim,77,"The usual, more or less. Musically, its her typical mix of pop-classicist balladry and hip-hop-tinged summer jamming, and if Carey doesn't exactly go strutting into new territory, its because she knows most people like her right where she is.","Jun 18, 2013"

Los Angeles Times,60,"What is unfortunately not elusive on the album are a clutch of interchangeable slow-to-midtempo tunes long on pulsating atmosphere--several with distractingly fidgety rhythmic tracks--but short on melody or verve.","Jun 18, 2013"
Absolute Punk (Staff reviews),60,"Undisciplined R&B pastiches, however, the album has in spades, especially ones that hearken back to her own career.... With surprising internal logic, the album's two unabashedly uptempo ditties are also the forums for Mariah's most serious-minded performances.","Jun 18, 2013"
cokemachineglow,60,"Admittedly, there's a good deal of clutter: not just 90s R&B throwbacks such as You're Mine (Eternal) and a gospelised cover of George Michael's One More Try, but an appearance by her three-year-old twins. Yet she's also at her most soulful and melodic, and the best of the bunch, such as the dreamy 70s disco of Meteorite, make this album a welcome return.","Jun 18, 2013"
Pitchfork,50,"Even for all its collaborations, bringing in Mary J Blige and R Kelly, the desperate skirting around for identity leaves this album feeling underwhelming.","Jun 18, 2013"
Record Collector,50,"Despite her Instagram and turnt-up references, the bounce brought to the album by of-the-moment hitmakers like MikeWiLLMadeIt and Hit-Boy and her undeniably personal subject matter, the record just doesnt have the same candid, bold edge that characterised Beyonces huge statement.","Jun 18, 2013"

AllMusic,85,"The expansive tracklisting makes for a CD-era 70+ minute listening experience. You can appreciate the varied approach that John and Bernie Taupin brought to the studio with the balladry (Candle In The Wind, surprisingly not a US-charting song), the ballsy (Saturday Nights Alright For Fighting) and the busy (Funeral For A Friend (Love Lies Bleeding)) even if the results led to a less-than-cohesive album on the whole.

AllMusic,60,"Throughout the album, Mr. Blacc sings with the kind of earthy vitality that many studied neo-soul singers dont have the voice to match.

Billboard.com,50,"Even a goofy Eminem cameo (the 'Allen Iverson of safe sex') can't save 'C'mon Let Me Ride' from sounding like an over-the-top hookup plea, and 'Final Warning,' a domestic-violence drama, feels vaguely like tabloid fodder.","Mar 24, 2009"

AllMusic,80,"The guys in Empire of the Sun manage to not only catch the lightning again, but their skill at crafting perfect pop, the depth in their songs, and the emotion their voices transmit make this record better than one might have ever expected. Modern pop doesn't get any better than this.","Mar 24, 2009"
RapReviews.com,80,"In essence, Ice On The Dune is pure pop with a twist--like a modern day 10cc, or ELO using synths instead of strings. [Jul 2013, p.75]","Mar 24, 2009"
The Independent (UK),75,"Harnessing a number of pop hit-making producers and mixers guarantees Ice On The Dune the requisite polish and shininess necessary for everyman's ear.

HipHopDX,70,"Like all good records, it has its magpie moments too - the Justice / Daft Punk tinged one-two of Celebrate and Surround Sound especially effective in the current climate--but fundamentally Ice On The Dune is the definitive Empire Of The Sun album.","Mar 24, 2009"
Slant Magazine,70,"The album is full of high-energy, highly-infectious dance numbers--in a way that demands frequently radio play, big-budget festival spots, distasteful Kesha collaborations, and another five year break between this and album #3.","Mar 24, 2009"
Entertainment Weekly,60,"Its neither better nor worse than Dream, but for all that talk of pushing through four dimensions (Surround Sound), the album remains planted in its comfort zone.","Mar 24, 2009"
AllMusic,60,"Ice on the Dune is a pretty impressive pop album. But it's hard not to wonder what might have been had just a bit of the fanciful imagination that goes into the visual side of Empire of the Sun been allowed to seep in.","Mar 24, 2009"
The Guardian,60,"The songs and melodies may be brighter, but there is a nagging sense throughout that something special has been lost somewhere in the process.","Mar 24, 2009"

The Observer (UK),50,"The vintage-Daft Punk cheese platter 'Celebrate' and album-ending Bowie joke 'Keep a Watch' are foamy fun, but too often Ice on the Dune just feels like a lobotomy on the dance floor.","Mar 24, 2009"
The Independent on Sunday (UK),40,"The problem is, when you project a futuristic, magical and otherworldly image, youd better have the sounds to match. And unfortunately, Ice On The Dune is a four-to-the-floor electro-pop album that has literally nothing to do with the cheesy fable invented to go with it.","Mar 24, 2009"

BBC Music,60,"This is a clangorous album in every way, full of brick-dense synths and abusive drums, and it often succeeds by blind force. But elsewhere the duo--Nathaniel Motte and Sean Foreman--are much slier and much more successful.","May 20, 2003"

Expert Witness (MSN Music),60,"If the album isn't quite a classic, it does represent its time in an unhurried, unselfconscious way: this is what big-budget rock sounded like in the mid-'70s, and expanding it to such an extravagant size doesn't hurt it because it always was bigger and bolder than its competitors.","Apr 22, 2003"

NOW Magazine,60,"Gatsby manages to avoid the major mistake that many soundtracks have, which is not keeping a uniform style throughout the album.

HipHopDX,50,"He's far better in originals like 'Gone, Gone, Gone' and his hit 'Home,' which build from folksy picking to hooting power-ballad choruses, a pleasantly popified take on Arcade Fire.

The A.V. Club,50,"Midtempo tracks like 'Only if for a Night,' 'No Light, No Light,' and 'What the Water Gave Me,' the latter of which finds Welch in full control of the room by the song's second half, are soulful, spooky, and bold.","Jun  4, 2002"

Dot Music,70,"The album unfolds an immeasurable amalgam of genres and inspirations, all fused together in a diamond-encrusted bubble of futuristic, day-glo hip hop. The energy is palpable, the pace rarely lets up, and personality pervades throughout.","May 21, 2002"
The Telegraph (UK),67,"On all of these songs, Nicki is dartboard focused-- she's rapping harder here than on almost anything from Pink Friday...  But much of Roman Reloaded sweats with a too-big-to-fail desperation.","May 21, 2002"

No Ripcord,50,"The result is a disjointed, artistically confused release that's not only way too long but also doesn't really ring true as an 'album' at all, at least if your definition is a collection of new songs with a central premise or statement that one listens to from start to finish.","May 21, 2002"
The A.V. Club,40,"A recipe for disaster which tries to please everybody and ends up being enjoyed by nobody.","May 21, 2002"

Hot Press,40,"So while Stronger has its redeeming moments, they mostly come when Clarkson does what she is renowned for doing and has already done better.

AllMusic,20,"Despite the references to Nietzsche and Einstein, which suggest a cachet Stronger doesn't deserve, this is simply an overlong string of standard putdown R&B and bogus emotional turmoil, the songs blitzed with generic power-ballad overkill.","Feb 19, 2002"

Rolling Stone,70,"Like any good album for the information age, Soul Punk is overloaded well past the point of saturation and its merciless in its attack, so it can be a bit overbearing, yet there's a real, vivid imagination behind its crystalline clamor.","Feb 12, 2002"

American Songwriter,75,"Her third solo album, Here I Am, proves that Ms. Rowland is doing just fine on her own, thank you; it's a solid if unambitious set of medium-hot finger snappers highlighted by the lusciously slinky top 20 hit ''Motivation''.","Jan 22, 2002"

Under The Radar,60,"Devoid of a true soul or sense of honesty Lights can be a pretty hollow listen.

Village Voice,40,"Because Light After Dark tries so hard to keep up with the tricks of the trade in 2011, it loses any sense of originality that Maguire brings to the table, which, especially in the pop music scene, is the only way to stand out.","Nov 13, 2001"

PopMatters,40,"Jackson's progressiveness and laser-aimed focus on perfection was always the foundation of everything he ever did and resonated through every song he ever made....Given the patch-work necessary to piece Michael together posthumously, it's impossible to imagine that this is a collection of songs Michael intended to deliver.","Oct 30, 2001"

Drowned In Sound,80,"The chilly Euro-house stylings may be a mite predictable but Diddy  proves a generous curator, laying on blockbuster exhibits and atmospheric slow jamz alike in the greatest cast-of-millions hip-hop joint since, well, Kanye's latest.","Oct 29, 2001"
The Guardian,80,"While the context may be different, Last Train to Paris suggests that, despite all the reality show-making, fashion designing, acting, inexplicable-name-changing, vodka-promoting, dressed-in-all-white-partying, skeet-shooting-with-Kevin-Spacey (probably) and all the other activities that make up a day in the life of Diddy, it's likely that he really does, and it shows.","Oct 29, 2001"
Uncut,80,"While it's clear that Last Train's combination of electro and house with hip-hop and R&B is Combs's baby, it's the group format that makes it work as an album.","Oct 29, 2001"

Pitchfork,70,"As with most of Diddy's ventures, his presence is largely behind the scenes as he turns in intermittent rhymes and fleeting commentary on the album's story line.","Oct 29, 2001"
Under The Radar,60,"The album is a mess, but a hook-heavy, likable one.","Oct 29, 2001"
AllMusic,60,"None of these guests feel out of place here, but not because of the potency of Diddy's vision. Rather, it's because they have made records like these elsewhere, giving Last Train to Paris a secondhand feel.","Oct 29, 2001"

Boston Globe,100,"Comparing him to other rappers is pointless: there are other guys with much more technically-sound flows (although Ye is as wickedly funny as he's ever been), but nobody else possesses the combination of hubris, imagination, neuroticism, and drive it takes to make a record like this.","Oct  9, 2001"

Q Magazine,83,"With nearly as many producers as songs, Libra Scale, Ne-Yo's fourth album, nevertheless hangs together sonically-these tracks move more fully into the synth-drenched Europop sheen that typified the first half of Year.","Sep 25, 2001"
Clash Music,80,"The real 'concept' here is: Michael Jackson tribute album. And a damn good one.","Sep 25, 2001"
musicOMH.com,70,"The level of sophistication--arrangements with subtle details, the frequency of slow tempos, a couple well-trodden motifs--lends itself to a couple tepid tunes, but Ne-Yo remains a premier source of R&B that is both traditional and contemporary.","Sep 25, 2001"
BBC Music,70,"If a little dominated by this trio [Champagne Life, One in a Million, Beautiful Monster] the rest of the album also develops the cool soul player theme nicely, with offers of mind sex and a considered approach in slick fusion.","Sep 25, 2001"
Drowned In Sound,70,"Comic-book-style inspiration notwithstanding, Libra Scale is enjoyable, but doesn't consistently reach the heights of 2008's adventurous 'Year of the Gentleman' or the peaks of his own stellar track record as a songwriter-for-hire to folks like Beyonce ('Irreplaceable') and Rihanna ('Take a Bow').","Sep 25, 2001"
The Guardian,70,"The only real slip-up on Libra Scale is when Ne-Yo moves just a little too far away from the R&B side and a little too far into the pop world....But even that low point isn't enough to taint another solid effort from a singer who doesn't really need trends, fads, collaborators or chart-topping hits anymore to prove that he belongs at the top of today's R&B world.","Sep 25, 2001"
Mojo,70,"Libra Scale is a tighter, more sophisticated and compelling album that borrows not just MJ's swoony-smooth melodies, but also his taste for roleplay.","Sep 25, 2001"
AllMusic,70,"Ne-Yo's best songs--like 'So Sick' from 2006 or 'Closer' from 2008, which he doesn't outdo on Libra Scale--are driven by obsessive longing, not self-satisfaction. And halfway through the album the tone changes.","Sep 25, 2001"
The Boston Phoenix,63,"Ultimately, it's admirable that Ne-Yo felt the need to take listeners on an out-of-this-world ride, but he's at his best when sticking closer to home.","Sep 25, 2001"

Billboard.com,60,"Musically, Ne-Yo spends most of his time here worshipping the throne of Michael Jackson ballads, which suits his falsetto crooning quite well. However, it's the handful of upbeat techno-influenced speaker-thumpers that stand out most, revealing his potential to be a much more versatile artist.","Sep 25, 2001"
AllMusic,60,"Despite Ne-Yo being absolutely serious about this--apparently, he spent three months alone developing the backstory--it doesn't feel markedly different from his first three albums. His strength remains his fluid melody-writing.","Sep 25, 2001"

Spin,70,"Sure, Max Martin's hooks, and especially Dr. Luke's neon-colored throb push these tunes into your head--they're in top form, aided by the tight focus of an eight-track EP, Cannibal's brevity trumping the scattershot Animal--but what makes them stick is Kesha, a pop star lacking pop star looks and a pop star voice.","Sep 18, 2001"

The A.V. Club,91,"From 'Don't F***ing Tell Me What to Do' to 'We Dance to the Beat,' her songwriting in that vein is as strong as anybody's. Scattered across her three 2010 CDs is one great album. How I wish this was it.","Sep 18, 2001"

PopMatters,75,"It's a formula that all parties involved-including producer Martin Rushent (The Human League, The Go-Go's)-know their way around, and thus anyone with an interest in unabashed pop filtered through a sparkling-clean indie-rock lens should have no problem getting swept up in the steady stream of instantly catchy choruses.","Sep 11, 2001"

The A.V. Club,60,"There's talent and potential here to do so by the boatload. But if they continue down this path, holding onto the nostalgia lever on one hand and trying desperately to expand and shed it on the other, they run the risk of becoming something even worse than a handy Sugarbabes reference; in the Pipettes, our generation could have our very own Sha Na Na if they aren't careful.","Sep 11, 2001"
Entertainment Weekly,50,"The voices can't equal, say, Bananarama's depth of feeling. But in tracks like 'Captain Rhythm'--which partly suggests 'Da Doo Ron Ron' on Jupiter--the Pipettes still ride the dance beat like a rocket ship.","Sep 11, 2001"
The Guardian,50,"'From Today' and 'I Need a Little Time' may have decent enough hooks and propulsive dance beats, but there's simply nothing about Earth vs. the Pipettes that's distinctive or in any way better than what other '80s revivalists have already done.","Sep 11, 2001"

New Musical Express (NME),91,"At times the album's lurid sexuality can feel forced: kink as oversold diva commodity.

Tiny Mix Tapes,67,"With Rated R, she waded further into the co-writing pool, and the album's resulting darkness could be attributed to her public personal struggles. She goes the exact opposite route on Loud, eschewing any co-writing credits, acting as a conduit for club and radio jams about sex, parties, and sexy parties.","Sep 11, 2001"
Rock Sound,60,"Maybe the good girl gone bad is getting better?","Sep 11, 2001"
Rolling Stone,60,"There is a clear aspiration for this album to be ubiquitous, and well, overbearing with tunes.

Lost At Sea,80,"Swift still prefers to write about her own broken love stories, the production is still a glossy pop-rock with only the faintest of country tinge to harken back to her roots, and Swift herself is still as dead-to-rights honest as she's always been.","Sep 11, 2001"

Drowned In Sound,71,"Speak Now solidifies Swift as a pop star in her own right. She may not have the edge of Lady Gaga or the sex appeal of a young Britney, but, much like Beyonce, she does want someone to put a ring on it-even if that does mean meeting her dad and promising you'll love her forever.","Sep 11, 2001"
Sputnikmusic,70,"While Taylor turns her wrath on a woman who steals her man on 'Better Than Revenge,' she turns that critical eye on herself in 'Back to December,' a thorough apology to a former lover she regrets having left behind.

Rolling Stone,80,"Dangerfield was in love and wanted to capture his euphoria as nature intended, and far from being schmaltzy, it's hard not to be swept along by his ardour and emotion; because the songwriting quality is so high, the tunes have an immediate, instant feel.","Jul 24, 2001"
AllMusic,75,"On this delightfully scrappy, self-released solo debut, the emotional weight shifts a bit more toward the light, while retaining the shoestring sophistication that makes the Guillemots so appealing.","Jul 24, 2001"
BBC Music,70,"Perhaps deemed too conventional for release with Guillemots, Fly Yellow Moon benefits greatly from its uncomplicated scope and stripped-down recording style.","Jul 24, 2001"
Pitchfork,60,"Dangerfields solo foray is a (for the most part) sparse production (it was recorded in just five days), and that extra room is a little jarring at first, but fans of the band, as well as the elusive quarry that is love, will no doubt walk away from Fly Yellow Moon a step or two lighter.","Jul 24, 2001"
Entertainment Weekly,60,"So, Fly Yellow Moon flirts with, but ultimately averts, disaster by virtue of the strengths we already know Fyfe Dangerfield to possess as Guillemots' principle songwriter: a knack for making bright pop songs on a life-affirming scale, delivered with an infectious and indefatigable enthusiasm.","Jul 24, 2001"

AllMusic,60,"The consistently diverting changes in style across the album are fine--the wonky 80s shoulder-pad pop of The Outsider is nothing like anything else here, for example.

Tiny Mix Tapes,80,"Nothing Hurts is a more honest, more somber take on the current garage wave. There's no sense of silliness or sniggering irony; these songs were written with a heavy heart, and that makes the record a lot more captivating, and a lot easier to invest in.","Jul 10, 2001"

Mojo,75,"Nothing Hurts is a small step forward for the typically single-note noise-pop revival, although the album is considerably dampened by Webbs vocals; deadpan and drab, his voice has far too much carefully crafted slack to it, not to mention a marked lack of hooks and conviction.","Jul 10, 2001"

AllMusic,80,"Forgiveness Rock Record is less about the eccentric and more about a band that, 10 years on, seems to be coming into its own. The endearing songwriting idiosyncrasies still exist (heck, the band concludes the album with two minutes of indie-soul titled 'Me and My Hand'), but this is a Broken Social Scene more ready for mass consumption. And, for once, that is not a bad thing.","Jun 19, 2001"
Dusted Magazine,80,"Luckily, the endlessly creative and surprisingly fluid Forgiveness Rock Record dispels any notion of opportunism by sticking to what the group does best: crafting clever, ramshackle, occasionally soaring bedroom pop songs (listen close for sirens) in a big expensive studio.","Jun 19, 2001"
musicOMH.com,80,"Despite the aimlessness of much of FRR's second half, nailing it is what BSS do brilliantly. There are enough moments of standout glory in the first half to sate any fan of this band, whatever part of their work they admire.","Jun 19, 2001"

Absolute Punk (Staff reviews),80,"Essentially, Forgiveness Rock Record finds Broken Social Scene trading 'big and loud' for 'wide and warm' and as a result sounding like they've really just settled further into their identity as a band.","Jun 19, 2001"
The A.V. Club,78,"The track 'Water in Hell' is an anthemic rocker with a catchy, shout-along chorus ('From what I can tell/There's water in hell!'), and 'Forced to Love' combines the band's usual grit and a hook that unexpectedly sticks, similar to 'Cause = Time' from its 2002 breakthrough release, 'You Forgot It in People.' Strangely enough, the new album's less pop-driven songs are hit or miss.","Jun 19, 2001"
Under The Radar,75,"Clocking in with 14 wide-screen songs, 'Forgiveness Rock Record' sounds trim and taut at nearly every turn. McEntire's nimble production keeps all the layers distinct, even when the band is whipping up a tender maelstrom of fey orchestration.","Jun 19, 2001"
Pitchfork,75,"The new BSS album may already have a lock on most dynamic record of the year.","Jun 19, 2001"
AllMusic,70,"Their fourth full-length has certain recurring quirks: skittery hi-hats, guitar lines to whistle along to, junk poetry sneered as if into a wind chamber. Blame a new emphasis on songwriting, never their strength, over sound-making.","Jun 19, 2001"
Filter,70,"the bulk of the tracks are the work of a septet consisting of frontman Kevin Drew, Brendan Canning, Sam Goldberg, Lisa Lobsinger, Justin Peroff, Charles Spearin, and Andrew Whiteman.

BBC Music,70,"Here, Canada's indie rock A-Team hasn't just reunited--it has border-hopped, aligning with kindred Great Lakes huddle-for-warmth art-rock communards in Chicago, where Tortoise leader John McEntire produced an antsier version of a great BSS record.","Jun 19, 2001"
musicOMH.com,70,"They've never let us down before, and they don't here, as frustrating as it is to hear the band fall just short of crafting something incredible. All the songs stand up, but the album loses steam and focus and begins to drag by the end of its 65 minute running time.","Jun 19, 2001"
Delusions of Adequacy,70,"As much as Broken Social Scene's identity is wrapped up in it's concept as a collective, their most transcendent moments are not their speedy grandiose party anthems but are instead the small soft details like the band setting into a slow almost improvisational groove in 'Sweetest Kill' or the hushed vocals of Emily Haines, Leslie Feist and Amy Millan singing in poignant unison on 'Sentimental X's.'","Jun 19, 2001"

Urb,50,"Unfortunately, BSS spreads itself too thin on the back nine, which, with the noted exception of Emily Haines' yearning 'Sentimental X's,' sounds like solo project B-sides (Kevin Drew's dream echo 'Sweetest Kill' and closer 'Me and My Hand') and studio outtakes (instrumental 'Meet Me in the Basement,' 'Highway Slipper Jam').","Jun 19, 2001"

Alternative Press,80,"While collaborator conductor Aldo Sisillo's orchestrations deserve a healthy dollop of credit for the overall sonic success of the album, Patton's voice is clearly the centerpiece.","Jun  5, 2001"
BBC Music,80,"These songs, penned by such as Ennio Morricone, Mina and Fred Bongusto, have been treated with the utmost respect. Patton has ensured that they are as authentic as possible by employing a 15-strong band together with a 40-piece orchestra.","Jun  5, 2001"

The Boston Phoenix,70,"It's little surprise that Mondo Cane is an album that--65 piece orchestra or not--is built around Patton's personality and voice, rather than his lyricism in the traditional sense.

The Guardian,82,"What makes In Evening Air a great break-up album is the same thing that makes Teen Dream (2010) a great break-up album: it's not exactly that the lyrics espouse these profound, poetic truths about relationships so much as they use sonic patterns and pretty mundane language to create a sad and disorienting sense of something very familiar disappearing.","May 15, 2001"

PopMatters,70,"In creating a work which pretty much unfailingly sounds like it could have been made 25 years ago, Future Islands have rejected a lot of current sonic trends--only for their sound to land fashionable-side-up anyway. The tunes are the thing, of course, and the tunes are good.","May 15, 2001"

The A.V.

BBC Music,65,"The arrangements stick to an effective coast-and-surge model of development: The tracks skim low and then tilt upward with the addition of a drum or synth part. It's a stock trick that works well, and Lali Puna use it with unusual tact.","May  1, 2001"
New Musical Express (NME),65,"The album sticks very much to the template of ambient keyboard pop and an atmosphere of disappointment that past Lali Puna and Notwist albums traded in.

Q Magazine,60,"Even those fleeting moments of adventurousness are not enough to make Our Inventions stand out in the realm of minimalist electronic pop (can I coin a genre name here?).

PopMatters,78,"The album moves from infatuation and jealousy to lust and betrayal to real, young love. And it does so with not just the best of intentions-- feminism, anti-homophobia, artistic experimentation-- but also, in the storytelling style of the Streets or Sweden's Hello Saferide, a set of distinctive, well-crafted songs that should strike a chord with self-deprecating teens and twentysomethings.","Mar 20, 2001"
Mojo,76,"My Best Friend is You is peppered with pettiness, too, but it's a little more grown-up-and way more amped-up.","Mar 20, 2001"
Uncut,75,"Nash is at her best here when she's following The Pipettes back to girl groups' heyday, and while it doesn't end with the bang that it starts with, My Best Friend Is You will make most people wish that their post-teen angst sounded this good.","Mar 20, 2001"
Hot Press,70,"Largely, though, Nash sounds just like herself, and that's exactly when she shines most brightly.","Mar 20, 2001"
BBC Music,70,"It feels like a definite upgrade for her, Kate Nash deluxe, courtesy of producer Bernard Butler's expectedly lavish touches. But her standard style of outloud diary readings are not privy to the same overhaul. They prevent it from feeling like much of a progression.","Mar 20, 2001"
The Guardian,70,"My Best Friend Is You is, indubitably, rather daring for a mainstream pop album. Yet for all the Butler-begat polish, it's hard to work out whether it really is a mainstream pop album.","Mar 20, 2001"
Uncut,70,"Longing for a woman's kiss, f-bombing a girl for selling herself short, and tasting the barrel of a gun, Nash is an oversharing spitfire who won't be ignored--not to mention a huge talent.","Mar 20, 2001"

Entertainment Weekly,60,"Disappointingly, she doesn't go all the way with this new, abrasive approach.

Boston Globe,82,"Clinging to a Scheme feels more haphazard, more Revolver (1965) than Abbey Road (1969) as it goes from searing ambience (A Token of Gratitude) to the thicker-figured dance tracks.

Chicago Tribune,80,"Further spins reveal the charms of the non-single tracks, and the whole thing ends up being one of the best examples of all the things that help make Swedish pop so magical.

The A.V. Club,70,"Emerging at the end, the listener has a real sense of having been immersed in something coherent and whole over the course of the 10 tracks; even if at the same time--dreamlike--there may well be no such clear sense of what it all might have meant.","Mar 20, 2001"
BBC Music,70,"It's somethng fans are sure to enjoy. [Winter 2010, p.65]","Mar 20, 2001"
AllMusic,60,"The Radio Dept. are comfortable in their safety, the masters of indie pop/shoegaze fence-sitting, neither here nor there in message or meaning.

Q Magazine,65,"Weathervanes is a darling, coherent, and certainly radio-friendly (if at times sugary) record.

Uncut,60,"As it is Weathervanes remains a catchy album that will satiate those with an indie-pop sweet tooth, (the type who can bear glockenspiel on every track) and maybe even offer the odd moment of genuine inspiration.

Billboard.com,50,"Too much of Weathervanes is unnecessary fluff. Of the album's 13 tracks, three are wordless moments of focus-less, meaningless noise and at least three other songs could have been trimmed down by a few minutes.","Mar  6, 2001"

Billboard.com,100,"On songs like the space-folky ''Long Hard Road'' and the reggae-scented ''Babyfather,'' Sade exhales peerlessly while the boys behind her fluff one heck of a sonic pillow. Weary bones, rest here.","Sep 19, 2000"
Absolute Punk (Staff reviews),91,"Soldier benefits from a divine sense of intimacy; Sade seems to be whispering secret thoughts directly into the listeners ears.","Sep 19, 2000"
Rolling Stone,88,"'Soldier of Love' is unique in its confrontational tone, but it connects to the other best tracks on this album, which employ minimalism and the rules of cool to carefully reconstruct various musical styles.","Sep 19, 2000"

Q Magazine,82,"Theyve plied a unique blend of jazz, world, pop and soul for more than a quarter-century, and now they add heavier beats, craftier production and a wider arsenal of sounds and styles.","Sep 19, 2000"
New Musical Express (NME),80,"There is gospel organ (Be That Easy) and a mid-tempo reggae-ish gait on Babyfather, but mostly Soldier of Love is as mournfully one-paced as previous Sade albums, with the same attention to texture and surface lustre but, alas, not to melody or moving autobiography.","Sep 19, 2000"
Dot Music,80,"Sure, the production on Soldier Of Love sounds a bit tougher and chunkier than the bands early work, but the classic Sade vibe we love is still front and centre.","Sep 19, 2000"
No Ripcord,80,"The qualities that millions of devoted fans enjoy about Sade are placed in new contexts on Soldier of Love.","Sep 19, 2000"
NOW Magazine,80,"These are songs that can sashay straight past you if you're not careful, but producer Stuart Matthewman (whose work with Maxwell sounds equally poured over) slips in subtle moments such as the twinkling percussion on Morning Bird and the slow-burn backing on opener The Moon And The Sky.","Sep 19, 2000"

Boston Globe,75,"But mostly Soldier of Love presents Sade as a genre unto herself; after 25 years, she remains alluring and subtly rewarding, while still keeping the listener at a safe distance, as if she had even deeper secrets to guard.","Sep 19, 2000"
Slant Magazine,70,"Like its predecessors, it mimics the rhythms of a new relationship - its up one minute and down the next, loving in places and wounded in others - and its a rich and rewarding album, but only after multiple listens.","Sep 19, 2000"
Uncut,70,"Soldier is sumptuously melancholy, exquisitely beautiful R&B, perfect for crying on a very expensive sofa.","Sep 19, 2000"

Boston Globe,70,"Soldier of Love offers listeners a rather narrow range of interest-- songs that (at their best) suggest strong feeling restrained by a fierce dignity-- but Sade remain the best at what they do.","Sep 19, 2000"

BBC Music,83,"The funkateers have infused YA-KA-MAY with an abundance of varied flavors as they skillfully back a wide range of NOLA musicians, from legendary artists such as singer Irma Thomas and producer-composer Allen Toussaint, to young rappers Katey Red and Sissy Nobby....The result is an often very tasty musical, uh, stew.","Sep 19, 2000"

Mojo,80,"Ya-Ka-May is not merely a collaborative amalgam of tracks, but rather a unified whole reflecting NOLAs musical vitality and reveling in it all simultaneously; it's the sound of a musical community being itself for itself, while screaming--in full party mode--into the world that it's alive and evolving.","Sep 19, 2000"

Pitchfork,75,"Named after a New Orleans street food, 'Ya-Ka-May' mixes a whole variety of ingredients that shouldn't hold together but do. While no record could truly capture the sound of New Orleans in 2010, Galactic sure has a great time trying.","Sep 19, 2000"
The Guardian,72,"For the most part, the popping bass and booming horns keep Ya-Ka-May simmering smoothly, refelcting NOLA's rich musical history while still manageing to sound unmistakably out of this world. [Winter 2010, p.98]","Sep 19, 2000"
The New York Times,70,"Galactic struggle to accompany all these signifying voices, sometimes resorting to hard, strident rhythms that don't really augment the performances.","Sep 19, 2000"

MSN Consumer Guide (Robert Christgau),90,"This could well be Midlake's masterpiece, which is saying something considering the esteem in which The Trials Of Van Occupanther is held.","Sep 12, 2000"
Chicago Tribune,90,"But theres a strong presence to the album, with its meticulous atmosphere and granite consistency of tone. The chiming guitars of a pair of Erics (Pulido and Nichelson), and the tasteful work of a the drummer McKenzie Smith bring gravity to the bands gloss on psychedelic folk.","Sep 12, 2000"
Los Angeles Times,88,"With 'The Courage of Others' (Bella Union), Midlake singer Tim Smith sounds like a refugee from the late 60s English-folk scene, with songs delivered in an unaffected, understated voice that couldve easily complemented Sandy Denny or Anne Briggs, or fit in with Pentangle or Fairport Convention.","Sep 12, 2000"
musicOMH.com,80,"A resolutely minor key offering, its even less instantly gratifying than before, precipitating its one central flaw: that these songs unfold at a leisurely pace  growing in stature as they progress from unassuming beginnings to sweeping crescendo  is admirable, but a touch overwhelming; even a little daunting on first exposure.","Sep 12, 2000"
AllMusic,80,"The third album from Texan quintet Midlake, it trembles with awe of sublime nature and sorrow for its destruction.","Sep 12, 2000"
Dot Music,80,"If its mournful epics you want, then the albums crammed full of them, from the strummed, outdoorsy sorrow of Winter Dies to Rulers, Ruling All Things, which is peppered with cheeky Spanish guitar and weighty, fin-de-sicle lyrical flair.","Sep 12, 2000"
Boston Globe,80,"Yet despite its cryptic, apocalyptic themes, its more appropriate to say that Courage Of Others is a more formal, deliberate album than its predecessor, owing less to take it easy leanings and more to the prodigious prog-folk of E.L.P., Giles & McDonald, or the most minor-key offerings of Pentangle.","Sep 12, 2000"
The New York Times,80,"Perhaps finding mass appeal has given Tim Smith and his band-mates the confidence to take their ideas into darker, brooding waters, and further harness the influence of classic British prog-folk. But whatever the motivation, it's a mood that suits.","Sep 12, 2000"
Vibe,80,"Or, more contemporaneously, you could say fans of fellow retro beard-rockers Fleet Foxes will find much to appreciate here. Radiohead fans, likewise, will relish Bring Down, a virtual rewrite of Exit Music. Everyone else will simply think its pretty.","Sep 12, 2000"
Rolling Stone,80,"Midlake has created an album that can subside on its own. It never reaches sublime territory and who knows, it may not even need it but for a few in tow, theres nothing rudimentary basic about The Courage of Others.","Sep 12, 2000"
Spin,80,"Instead of warm colours they work with a more monochromatic palette. There's darkness, rain, a chill in the air, remoteness, a sense of nature--and more of than not, a very British remoteness and sense of nature. [Feb 2010, p.90]","Sep 12, 2000"

Entertainment Weekly,79,"'The Courage of Others' doesn't offer anything as immediately captivating as 'Van Occupanther' gems like 'Roscoe' and 'Young Bride,' but the new songs slowly take shape and are unafraid to choose interesting detours.","Sep 12, 2000"

AllMusic,70,"Furthermore, the way that 'Rulers Of Ruling Things', 'The Horn' and 'The Courage Of Others' arch effortlessly into trippier psych-rock inflected territory suggest a more expansive, weirder Midlake to come.","Sep 12, 2000"
Pitchfork,70,"Its more difficult to get into. The melodies dont overwhelm you--in fact, each song blends together under Tim Smiths folky chant. But the similar tone that overtakes each song builds on you as you listen making this album powerful in a different way than Occupanther.","Sep 12, 2000"
PopMatters,60,"Even though the lyrics stay hippy-dippy, there are hard-earned moments of musical release.","Sep 12, 2000"
RapReviews.com,60,"Like ...Van Occupanther, The Courage Of Others is texturally rich and technically refined, elegantly capturing the ambience of the folk rock scene to which it pays fulsome tribute. But sadly, there's something cold and unwelcoming at its core.","Sep 12, 2000"
Entertainment Weekly,50,"Yet they never come, and without the vivid talents of their heroes  Sandy Denny, Richard Thompson, John Renbourn  Midlake's abstracted invocations of maidens, merchant ships and 'ancient light' feel a bit bookish and distant.","Sep 12, 2000"

musicOMH.com,50,"Who I Am is so polished and adult-sounding -trading teen pop moxie for organ and slide guitar-that one is left wondering whether the same songs about love, heartbreak and political curiosity wouldn't be a more satisfying evolutionary step in the hands of a scrappier troupe.","Sep 12, 2000"
New Musical Express (NME),40,"N Jos fan base doesnt care about calculation. Theyre just the right age to buy into the workmanlike quasi-genuine rock of Who I Am. And theres still enough of that original Jonas flavour to keep them interested.","Sep 12, 2000"
Entertainment Weekly,40,"It's still a too-polished, kid-friendly approximation of a rock record, splitting the difference between the ill-fitting maturity of 2009's 'Lines, Vines and Trying Times' and the lukewarm soul affectation of John Mayer's 'Battle Studies.'","Sep 12, 2000"
Boston Globe,40,"Should his solo career continue, this record could stand as an in between point between his teen past and his adult future, but as it stands now, it's just a muddled, occasionally interesting but often baffling pop-rock album.","Sep 12, 2000"

Billboard.com,88,"A dense yet buoyant mixture of hip-hop beats, reggae grooves, African-pop riffs and future-soul vocals, 'Concrete Jungle' (which culls tracks from Nneka's previous European releases) does, in fact, echo 'The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill.'","Sep 12, 2000"

Observer Music Monthly,70,"Even if Paper Dolls isnt as ambitious or immediately satisfying as Structure and Cosmetics, it offers plenty of small pleasures for Brunettes fans, who still walk the line between cheery and melancholy in their own unique way.","Sep 12, 2000"
Rolling Stone,70,"There might be a few lost moments where the music stagnates from a lack of true skill where neither member of the pair does much but they come in sparring moments. And for the most part, the songs are too direct to even truly analyze them as anything more than lifting, carefree music.","Sep 12, 2000"
Q Magazine,60,"Sure, the electro-pop leanings on Paper Dolls may sap their songs of some of the dreamy haze they had before, but in its place we get an immediate brightness to this collection, one that doesnt fade with repeat plays.

Slant Magazine,70,"For all that is revealed about Charlottes experiences via the songs on this album, there is always the knowledge that Beck is the songwriter, which raises the questions of how close Charlotte is to the lyrics, and if Beck has transcribed what Charlotte described to him with minimal interference, or if his own views and ideas have shaped the finished work and altered Charlottes original intent.","Sep  5, 2000"

NOW Magazine,60,"IRM is an album that refuses to cast Gainsbourg as the chanteuse some would like to see her as, and her willingness to gamble with her persona and musical style is laudable. However, this risk-taking attitude results in an inconsistent jumble of ideas that ends up being much less of a peek inside what it is to be human than the title might suggest.","Sep  5, 2000"
The New York Times,60,"As a pairing between two artists, the album works, though not nearly as much as it could have if both were at the top of their game.","Sep  5, 2000"
MSN Consumer Guide (Robert Christgau),60,"With its profusion of delicate acoustic guitar arpeggios and fine string arrangements by Beck's father David Campbell, much of the rest of IRM steers a more organic, at times almost skiffle-like path, but the twist is Gallic melancholy.

The Boston Phoenix,60,"IRM proves suitably unconventional thanks to the presence of co-writer and producer Beck Hansen, who plays fast and loose with Gainsbourg's breathy chanson, skipping from spiky percussion (Master's Hands) to lush orchestration (Vanities) even joining her at the mic for jaunty, '60s-flavoured duet Heaven Can't Wait.

Rolling Stone,90,"Dream is a go-for-broke collection that not only creates and sustains a hi-fi drowse-pop drama throughout its 10 beguiling songs, but comes across like a logical and gorgeous extension of all the bands previous dreams.","Aug 29, 2000"
Dot Music,90,"It helps that Teen Dream, Beach House's third album, is the best thing the band has done. Legrand and her bandmate, Alex Scally, have been ready for a homerun shot since 2006's selt-titled debut, and they cracked this one into the stratosphere.","Aug 29, 2000"
PopMatters,90,"This is both the most diverse and most listenable of their three full-lengths, and yet it never seems like a compromise.

Under The Radar,90,"2008's critically lauded 'Devotion' set the band on a new path, landing them an opening spot for buzz band Grizzly Bear and winning the hearts of hipsters the world over. Teen Dream, however, takes things to a whole new level.","Aug 29, 2000"
The New York Times,90,"Though it's not as eclectic and whimsical as their earlier work, Teen Dream is some of their most beautiful music, and reaffirms that they're the among the best purveyors of languidly lovelorn songs since Mazzy Star.","Aug 29, 2000"
Entertainment Weekly,90,"Beach House makes it easy on Teen Dream, supplying an intense but transparent sheen of iridescent sound, marking an album whose quality is almost instantly evident. Better than anything in recent memory, the album typifies the difference between sonic interference as an instrumental tool and a blanket to hide beneath.","Aug 29, 2000"
Boston Globe,84,"Teen Dream is just such a fantastic pop record because it never seems to try to be: its almost as if the duo had intended to make another mopey shoegazing affair and accidentally stumbled upon something transcendent.","Aug 29, 2000"
AllMusic,80,"This Baltimore dream-pop duo, whose dense-fog organs, reverb-y slide guitars, and nodding harmonies feel as lush as a midnight walk in a wet garden. On their third album, those feelings now sound like actual songs, with swelling choruses and an all-encompassing ache.","Aug 29, 2000"
Los Angeles Times,80,"Teen Dream finds the duo resolving to present their songs in somewhat firmer strokes. Nothing rocks, exactly, but organs coo in sharper focus, drum machines bear with added vigour, and an eerie disquiet occasionally linger. [Feb 2009, p.79]","Aug 29, 2000"
The Guardian,80,"They occupy an ethereal wonderland of their own design on Teen Dream, a place where '80s soft rock mingles with slow-pop soliloquies, producing an oscillating, supernal bliss both sparkling and somber. [Feb 2010, p.92]","Aug 29, 2000"
PopMatters,80,"Overall, Teen Dream lives up to its promise of youthful fantasy. [Holiday 2009, p.76]","Aug 29, 2000"
Slant Magazine,80,"The most unmistakeable sound on Teen Dream is that of a band truly finding its own voice. In so doing, they may just have minted the new decades first essential album.","Aug 29, 2000"
Entertainment Weekly,80,"Many have already been drawn into the melancholy whirlpools of their past two albums; yet more will surely be drawn by the warmer embrace of Legrand and Scallys latest statement, a stronger, rhythmic definition offering a hand through the ether, beckoning the listener into their fluid tapestry.","Aug 29, 2000"
The Guardian,80,"Instead of modest waltzes and looped drum machines, theres an evident maturity in the way the production unveils itself as richer and far more multifaceted. When you cant break the familiar, expanding on those opportunities only makes you more in control.","Aug 29, 2000"
Dot Music,80,"Beach House have reached the point in their career where achieving grand melodic climaxes seems to come to them effortlessly, and on Teen Dream the climaxes are as thrilling as ever before.","Aug 29, 2000"
Los Angeles Times,80,"Ultimately it's an incredibly rewarding listen, even if the self-observing anxiety that's writ large throughout means it doesn't quite reach the lofty heights to which its creators have bravely aspired.","Aug 29, 2000"

Spin,80,"By tightening things up, another sprightly highlight emerges from this pleasant haze.","Aug 29, 2000"

Hot Press,70,"Teen Dream is kind of MOR, it would go down a treat at a dinner party, there are boring bits and the doleful DIY magic of the debut seems to have more or less run out. But its shot through with more than a handful of heartstoppingly wonderful moments.","Aug 29, 2000"
PopMatters,70,"Teen Dreams best material comes up front (Zebra, Silver Soul, Norway Walk in the Park) , and theres a bit of a sag in the middle (Lover of Mine, Better Times), with songs that are pretty enough, but without any big payoffs.","Aug 29, 2000"
Mojo,70,"They're more radiant than ever on their third disc, particularly on songs like 'Zebra,' with background chorales swooping over stately guitar plucking.","Aug 29, 2000"
Q Magazine,67,"A solid third LP, but it's not Beach House's 'masterpiece.' They've still got some gold dust to kick up.","Aug 29, 2000"
Uncut,60,"Their dedication to refined, pretty songs means there's a very narrow scope here that didn't afflict Grizzly Bear's 'Veckatimest' and which makes proceedings here sound a little wan and wishy-washy after a while.","Aug 29, 2000"

Urb,80,"Heart of My Own sounds more produced than Oh, My Darling, but not for lack of quality. Despite the yearning lyrical plotlines, the warmth exuded from the woodsy harmony of Bulats voice mingling with the amalgamation of guest instruments cozies even the bitterest of winter days.","Aug  1, 2000"
The A.V. Club,78,"It's upbeat even if most of Bulats songs dwell on heart-ache and loss. That notion is on par with every singer-songwriter these days but her voice drives these concepts into a feeling thats genuine. In other words, Bulat can pine with the best of them.","Aug  1, 2000"

Drowned In Sound,60,"But despite the lack of surprise, Gold Rush is a fine, rollicking jig, and Sparrow's skeletal voice and uke combo feels like it's been pulled from the ground still caked in Prairie soil. [Feb 2010, p. 94]","Aug  1, 2000"

Slant Magazine,80,"With 33 tracks stretching well over two hours, A Reality Tour isnt exactly suited to single-sitting listening.

PopMatters,70,"Nobody really knows if Bowie is hanging up the spacesuit for good, since the man has been periodically announcing his retirement since 1973. But if so, this is one hell of an exit.","Aug  1, 2000"
Rolling Stone,60,"This is Bowie in his mode as a crowd-pleasing professional, playing with considerable charm and skill, offering no surprises but plenty of pleasure: it's not the first album that will come to mind when thinking of live Bowie, but as it's playing, it's hard to resist.","Aug  1, 2000"

AllMusic,80,"The Colossus finds Rjd2 back to doing what he did when he first began recording: simply curating excellent productions instead of wooing a new audience by creating expressly written songs or telling a story with his full-lengths.","Jun 20, 2000"

Entertainment Weekly,70,"The multi-genre approach of The Colossus is refreshing.","Jun 20, 2000"
Los Angeles Times,70,"The beat is generally the best part of any track produced by RJD2, but The Colossus--the first album on his new label, RJs Electrical Connections--finds him juggling vintage samples, string and horn parts, vocals both outsourced and original.","Jun 20, 2000"
Paste Magazine,68,"The Colossus, as its name implies, strives for scale, but also strains a bit under a heavy burden. While Rjd2 excels at sonic collages, the mixed motives on this album--a current spin on past techniques, a synthesis of old songs and a turn toward the future--are difficult to balance.","Jun 20, 2000"
Rolling Stone,60,"RJD2 is still in a class of his own, and The Colossus is charming enough. Krohn might have temporarily given up on expanding his stylistic horizons, but he sounds comfortable again, certainly a small step taken toward a more fortunate future.","Jun 20, 2000"
PopMatters,60,"Wisely, he doesnt sing this time around, leaving that to Kenna and Phonte of Little Brother. But the tracks with guest vocals never really take off either, reinforcing the producers weakness as a songwriter.","Jun 20, 2000"

AllMusic,83,"To some extent, Astro Coast comes off like a muscular, radio-ready version of music that would've been found on a limited-edition 45 back in the mid-'90s.

The New York Times,82,"Ambition can just as easily manifest itself as a desire to create a relentlessly catchy, 'classic indie' album in your own dorm room, and if that's what Surfer Blood set out to do, Astro Coast succeeds wildly.","Oct 19, 1999"
Sputnikmusic,81,"As you might imagine, it's yet another interpretation of classic surf-rock, but as crowded as this scene seems to have gotten lately, most of its practitioners do the style quite well.

AllMusic,80,"Astro Coast succeeds admirably because it pulses with a fun, youthful, and invigorating feel, and obvious lack of arty pretenses, studio mediation, or self-importance. Not every band can be Radiohead, thankfully.","Oct 19, 1999"

Boston Globe,70,"Pavement noise scrimmages, warped Pixies surf rock, fresh-faced Weezer tuneage, it's all the same mess to them. But they dress up their guitar-mad escapades in a stadium-echo kick that Nineties indie kids were too grumpy to try.","Oct 19, 1999"

Hot Press,67,"All the songs on Astro Coast, the 10-song debut from South Florida quartet Surfer Blood, hinge on the mighty riff. Guitarist John Paul Pitts' vocals are secondary, and the guitar compensates, weaving Built to Spill's guitar heroism into three-minute shards of pop-punk.","Oct 19, 1999"

AllMusic,55,"Even at its best this whole record sounds like a band who wants to make an impact by trying to be everything to everyone.

The Guardian,91,"The 10 songs here don't collectively match the near-perfection displayed on the band's debut, but Contra is varied and vivacious enough to make each spin as revelatory as the first time you realized what the band was getting away with and how well it pulled off the feat.","Sep  7, 1999"

PopMatters,80,"It's fair to say that with so much going on 'Contra' is much less immediate than its predecessor, requiring a bit of patience to uncover its true shades, contours and charm. But it's certainly worth sticking with, because with their second album Vampire Weekend have escaped their collegiate niche without sacrificing their true essence.","Sep  7, 1999"
Prefix Magazine,80,"While Koenig rarely shies away from scholastic lyricizing, Contra succeeds apart from its cultural asides and college textbook hat-tips.","Sep  7, 1999"

AllMusic,80,"As the watery floating of 'I Think Ur A Contra' draws the album to a close, it becomes clear that not only did the members of Vampire Weekend succeed in creating an excellent sophomore album; they've managed to survive long enough to outlive their hype and its attendant backlash.","Sep  7, 1999"

Mojo,80,"Vampire Weekend's willingness to write an album of exciting new material, rearranging the very core of the sound they've come to be known for, will be maddening on first listen for those who loved their debut--but those who stick it out will discover that there's a more mature, innovative band in its place.","Sep  7, 1999"
PopMatters,80,"Contra may not propose much of a rebuttal to those who thumbed their nose up at the band's past work, but it's not difficult to see how it could strengthen their core audience while netting them some new fans at the same time.","Sep  7, 1999"
Hot Press,80,"Any fears that the zippy Afro-pop of these New York-based hipsters was a novelty--so very 2008--are quickly dispelled on this confident and completely entertaining second album.","Sep  7, 1999"

Filter,70,"It's ironic and ill-fitting that such ditch-hopping actually embroils them in impassioned debate--and it's a credit to them that, love or hate these songs' lack of drama, you'll remember them very, very well.","Sep  7, 1999"
The Boston Phoenix,60,"Contra is a solidly entertaining, well-constructed album, and if people take to it, the tendency to mock the band will, I think, fade, simply because it doesn't have obviously unfashionable moments to feel uneasy about.","Sep  7, 1999"
The A.V. Club,56,"Why Vampire Weekend seem uninterested in being a no frills pop band is a mystery.
