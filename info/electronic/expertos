Mojo,67,"Traditionally, M.I.A. peaks when she melts her musical influences, but on AIM, theres this lingering feeling that too many of the songs were left half-baked.

Resident Advisor,60,"Maya Arulpragasam's radical patter is sounding a bit ho-hum ('Borders: what's up with that?' she wonders on her fifth album).

Exclaim,80,"Even though Frahm shines on Oddments of the Gamble though his exquisite use of the Rhodes, the real stars of this record come through the application of percussion, as performed by Gmeiner and Andrea Belfi.","Nov  4, 2016"
PopMatters,80,"Theres youthful playfulness at hand on Oddments. Theres also a kind of majesty, one borne out by an affinity for subtly grand melodies, which works in juxtaposition to the albums brief, jewel-like cuts--most of these tracks clock in at well under four minutes, and the entire LP barely reaches 40 minutes.","Nov  4, 2016"
Tiny Mix Tapes,80,"More than simply a side project and definitely not just a collection of cast-offs, Oddments Of The Gamble is a remarkably cohesive listen for something assembled over time and without restrictions.","Nov  4, 2016"
Exclaim,80,"For a record that is largely improvised, it is stunning that such a cohesive piece can be put together and it will be fascinating to see what other tricks this trio has up their sleeve.","Nov  4, 2016"
AllMusic,80,"For an album comprised entirely of outtakes, Oddments of the Gamble sounds surprisingly realized and complete.","Nov  4, 2016"
Mojo,75,"The only weakness of oddments is the occasional breaks in the overall flow, moments where tracks fade away too soon or stretch on too long, or where a massive peak is dropped off immediately into a spacy low. But these breaks are infrequent, only jarring because of the comforting haze the record consistently meets.","Nov  4, 2016"
PopMatters,70,"Its really the power of the synthesizer that allows his playing and compositions to breathe, to carry the music into the z axis. And while this new dimension may not present much in the way of a challenge for Frahm or for us as listeners, its chill indeed, and also beautiful.","Nov  4, 2016"
Mixmag,70,"The musical direction of this album doesn't diverge from the tape-heavy, field-recording based style nonkeen have established for themselves previously. This is all well and good and makes for a solid record, but the album highlight lies where the formula changes somewhat.","Nov  4, 2016"
Resident Advisor,70,"Several shorter, fragmentary cuts provide glimpses of indescribable studio happenings that can't be replicated. Titles like 'Copy of Crazy' and 'The Monkey in the Machine' hint at the playful, slightly chaotic nature of these sessions.","Nov  4, 2016"

Drowned In Sound,90,"Even if youre not spiritually inclined, the music is still proper techno: chuggy in some places and mystical in others, but always total class.","Oct 28, 2016"
AllMusic,80,"This particular release has all the textures, tinkles and poise the listener craves from Moss, while often arming them with some pretty hefty, distorted kicks and bass.","Oct 28, 2016"
The Line of Best Fit,80,"Bullish and forceful, The Discos of Imhotep is also a work of considerable intricacy and mystery. Jamal Moss aims high and rarely overreaches, making the album not only ambitious, but a welcome blast of modern house that would live up any club night.","Oct 28, 2016"
Pitchfork,80,"The comparison between [The Disco's of Imhotep] and Ancient Echoes revealing the absolutely consistency of Moss's vision over the years. [Aug 2016, p.50]","Oct 28, 2016"
Exclaim,80,"This is a kaleidoscopic, hard-hitting record designed for the feet as much as the synapses, healing by frequencies.","Oct 28, 2016"
Consequence of Sound,80,"The release does an excellent job of touching on several facets of Moss' personality, and will most certainly encourage newcomers to seek out as many of his other recordings as possible.","Oct 28, 2016"
The Guardian,80,"Sweaty and ecstatic, elevated and pure, The Discos of Imhotep weaves quite the spell. This might be the most accessible Hieroglyphic Being album to date, but Jamal Moss remains out there on his own.","Oct 28, 2016"
PopMatters,80,"This is techno music that fires the mind and soothes the soul; intricate, micro-tuned productions that work on a guttural level; electronic music that soars by aural intelligence rather than lumpen sonic trickery. In the end, you may not be healed by The Discos of Imhotep but youll certainly be uplifted.","Oct 28, 2016"
AllMusic,80,"Where previous releases under the moniker have explored the grittier, DIY side of house, here Moss leans towards the lush, psychedelic end of the spectrum, and delivers a kaleidoscopic sonic journey that commands you to keep going back.","Oct 28, 2016"
Mixmag,70,"A premise so potentially sprawling is over and done with after 35 minutes. As the conduit probably has his next spiritual plain and energy source in mind, it all adds to the enigma.","Oct 28, 2016"
Pitchfork,70,"For an artist who has released as prolifically as Moss, having a defining solo album is a hard choice. But this is an excellent primer for Jamal Mosss singular ideology, and deserves our dual attention.","Oct 28, 2016"
Resident Advisor,70,"Though at times a little too cacophonous, the nine-track LP is an impressive collection that remains true to its Afrofuturistic roots.","Oct 28, 2016"
Pretty Much Amazing,60,"It's foundations are suitably raw, emotional and, more often than not rhythmically muscular. And yet, by skillfully offsetting this by weaving in strands of Afro-jazz, the pervading mood is one of calming, introspective reverie. [Sep 2016, p.93]","Oct 28, 2016"

Entertainment Weekly,80,"ts a record about how the night is more than just an expanse of time to sleep through or drink away. Indeed, through Wests eyes, its much more: a richly populated terrain where life can be discovered, avowed, and confronted, even in the darkest of corners.","Oct 28, 2016"
New Musical Express (NME),70,"It takes us back to the late 00s, when the likes of Martyn, Sepalcure and Joy Orbison were bringing lushness and melody to (post) dubstep--and thats no bad place to be at all.","Oct 28, 2016"
Q Magazine,70,"While there's certainly a sorrowful theme to this album, it doesn't seem like West is merely interested in creating dark, depressing music; there's still something hopeful and encouraging about it.","Oct 28, 2016"
RapReviews.com,70,"West, when left alone to his devices, is able to transform emotion into the esoteric, colluding synthesis into vibrant, organic swaths of sound. Rhythmically taking jabs like hesitation marks, throwing caution to the wind.","Oct 28, 2016"
The Line of Best Fit,70,"On Night Melody, West has created a touchingly personal piece of art that feels more like an addendum to Howl than a jarringly new chapter in his musical journey.","Oct 28, 2016"
The Quietus,64,"The mood of each piece sticks to a narrow range between quietly brooding and vaguely anthemic. But it's not only business as usual for Rival Consoles. In small pockets and slight gestures, distinctive traits emerge from West's symphonic electronics.","Oct 28, 2016"

AllMusic,78,"Many of the tracks on Hangin' At The Beach, much like Pink's low-key classic 'Life In LA,' grapple with the paradox of feeling lonely and alienated in paradise. Perlman's able to evoke these ideas without lyrics, using a casual, collagist approach to create his most profound work to date.","Oct 28, 2016"
musicOMH.com,75,"You get the sense that he can go pretty much anywhere sonically, and the brevity of each track combined with all the driving rhythms makes the record feel like a roller-coaster tour of his firing neurons.","Oct 28, 2016"
Boston Globe,70,"The album is clearly the product of the artist's singular vision rather than anything created with commercial expectations, and while certain listeners might find it indulgent or amateur-sounding, give it a chance and it might prove to be a rewarding, amusing listen.","Oct 28, 2016"
Exclaim,70,"Fans of surrealist, lo-fi beats and the 1980s will finds Edwards' beach worth visiting.","Oct 28, 2016"
Consequence of Sound,60,"There are rhythms and sounds that instantly come off as nostalgic, but in the best moments the beats and textures merge to form something wholly unidentifiable.","Oct 28, 2016"

Under The Radar,83,"Encore keeps the party rocking while barely missing a dance step.","Oct 28, 2016"
No Ripcord,70,"Overall, Encore is a worthwhile listen. It obviously suffers from many of the problems that dance music albums generally suffer from but it does well to show off Snake's ear for hooks just as well as his ear for drops.","Oct 28, 2016"
NOW Magazine,53,"The album is simply not the format for DJ Snake. The conventional song barely is. He makes tracks. Instead of being, at least, a collection of great, standalone singles, the album is riddled with ill-advised rap songs and bad ballads.","Oct 28, 2016"
Clash Music,50,"Like most DJ albums, unfortunately, Encore does little with its A-list guests.","Oct 28, 2016"

Los Angeles Times,80,"Its really interesting seeing how much chemistry Dubz and Giggs still have; it feels like theres still some space for Ard Bodied 2.","Oct 28, 2016"
The Observer (UK),80,"Landlord is fantastic, crafted, big-stage trap with the lissom, conversational feel of a mixtape.","Oct 28, 2016"
Slant Magazine,80,"The occasional leaden production job remains the albums main stumbling block. But if Giggs is unlikely to follow Stormzy into the mainstream, its hard to deny this records bleak intensity or lyrical command.","Oct 28, 2016"
The Independent (UK),60,"While by no means poor, this album does little to advance the reputation he has already secured, as one of the UKs most reliable rap suppliers.","Oct 28, 2016"

Rolling Stone,90,"Interior Architecture is presented as a clear tome of mind, four slabs of endless, drifting synthesis, abstract in concept yet rich with neural networking.","Oct 28, 2016"
DIY Magazine,90,"What makes Interior Architecture such a success, though, is how effortless his attention to detail feels, as each movement flows into another to help create an experimental noise concept album.","Oct 28, 2016"
The Guardian,70,"The record is not always as engaging for the listener as it might like to be. Gengras emphasizes the experience of sound over the process of constructing it.","Oct 28, 2016"
Pitchfork,68,"He's essentially building sonic environments, the kind a listener can enter and explore. That experience is less about the details than the journey, which Gengras carves out with the skill of a seasoned designer.","Oct 28, 2016"

Paste Magazine,80,"MSTRKRFT and Keeler have never been ones for half measures. Operators overall refusal to do just that, its inexorable 808 death march through a digital hell, makes it MSTRKRFTs best album yet, not to mention an impressive approximation of DFA1979s live show, in spirit if not in sound.","Oct 28, 2016"
The New York Times,80,"On Operator, MSTRKRFT seem uninterested in fitting in with current mainstream EDM trends, and that gives them the freedom to come up with something that still has just enough in common with their past to satisfy long-time fans.","Oct 28, 2016"
The A.V. Club,80,"MSTRKRFT themselves have quit trying to mask anything about their sound or approach, electing instead to deliver the turbo-aggressive noise record theyve always threatened to make.","Oct 28, 2016"
Drowned In Sound,70,"Without clear-cut standouts, Operator is really a full-album listening experience. This may hinder casual fans--there's no 'Bounce' or 'Heartbreaker' here--but diehards and lovers of more challenging electronic music will appreciate the chaotic journey of Operator.","Oct 28, 2016"
PopMatters,70,"The MSTRKRFT formula of tight, catchy loops remains unchanged after all--they've just gotten a lot darker.","Oct 28, 2016"
Pitchfork,67,"MSTRKRFT is certainly far more inventive than most, so the songs arent boring, just unmoored. However, it does make Operator a frustratingly uneven listen.","Oct 28, 2016"
Mojo,65,"The ten tracks here are all honest executions of a sound that was essentially perfected ten years ago; nostalgia alone cant justify how little legitimately new material MSTRKRFT bring to the table.","Oct 28, 2016"
AllMusic,60,"Ultimately, the harder, almost techno-inclined instrumental tracks, such as Little Red Hen or Death in the Gulf Stream, are infinitely better than those burdened with vocals, some lairy and crass, some merely unengaging.","Oct 28, 2016"
PopMatters,60,"So far, so great. But when the use of vocals is taken into overdrive on final track Go On Without Me, where Jacob Bannon from hardcore punks Converge offers up his jarring scream, its almost on the borderline of becoming too much.","Oct 28, 2016"
Uncut,60,"The blitzkrieg is offset by a vein of black humour, epitomised by Ian Svenonius' hilariously pitiless guest vocal on 'Party Line.' But as with any military campaign, fatigue eventually sets in. [Aug 2016, p.80]","Oct 28, 2016"
Magnet,50,"There is plenty of decent stuff going on in the duo's third record, but it still never really takes off into any rarified territory.","Oct 28, 2016"
The Quietus,50,"Ultimately, their third record doesn't show MSTRKRFT to be master craftsmen.","Oct 28, 2016"
HipHopDX,42,"Operator drags the listener kicking and screaming into what sounds like the soundtrack to the depths of hell, where the only music available is an unrelenting, want-to-bang-your-head-against-the-wall symphony of noise.","Oct 28, 2016"
Uncut,40,"With Runaway, MSTRKRFT find a balance between the antagonistic incursion and electro-funk wizardry, but asides from that standout, the record as a whole is a jarring affair.","Oct 28, 2016"
AllMusic,40,"Bursts of corrosive techno that have all the instrumental variety of a car alarm. [Sep 2016, p.108]","Oct 28, 2016"
Clash Music,40,"Theres a glimmer of what could have been on Runaway, its whirring wooze like a motorbike riding its front wheel deliriously along inky tarmac, driven by a doo-doo-doo pop hook.","Oct 28, 2016"
Pitchfork,40,"Hard-partying techno heads will love the anxiety-inducing tone of Operator; others may see this as a missed opportunity, after a regenerative five-year hiatus, for MSTRKRFT to explore creative nuance over noise.","Oct 28, 2016"
Mojo,20,"With the continually progressive and impressive places electronic music and its satellite genres are going, Operator is a regression to the uninspiring basics.","Oct 28, 2016"

The A.V. Club,85,"This is experimental music at its very finest, and rarest: unashamedly cerebral, but also unrelenting in its dedication to powerful dynamics and--crucial point, this--melodic hooks.","Oct 28, 2016"
Drowned In Sound,80,"Fortunately, its a strong, welcome follow-up: potent melodies, expert performances, and a boundary-pushing experimental nature that is both an enjoyable listen and an even deeper dive into uncharted musical waters.","Oct 28, 2016"
AllMusic,80,"The record is comfortably balanced between different periods of Shepherd's work, derailing expectation surrounding followups, all while still obfuscating the line between analog and digital. For Floating Points, it's business as usual.","Oct 28, 2016"
Exclaim,75,"All in all, the full 30 minutes of Kuiper seems logical as a comfortable extension of, and compromise between, Shepherd's recent discography: as he continues to unravel the additional possibilities of live instrumentalism, we can be sure to expect plenty more of the same.","Oct 28, 2016"
PopMatters,75,"Kuiper shows Shepherd as an artist still exploring his craft, feeling his way through new surroundings. Though his approach is methodical and workmanlike, he still manages to weave together explosive, transcendent moments throughout.","Oct 28, 2016"
Tiny Mix Tapes,73,"The moody guitar solo at the end is deflating endpoint to a well-trodden path, but Shepherds band nonetheless exhibits a rare combination of restraint and brawn.","Oct 28, 2016"
Pitchfork,60,"It's a solid denouement to Elaenia's touring cycle, and perhaps helps us appreciate that album for its use of exactly the right tools for the job and appropriate scope for its ideas.","Oct 28, 2016"
Mixmag,60,"While both tracks suffer from their length, there is still an underlying hint of Shepherd's innovative mastery. It's the failure of this to come to the fore that means the Kuiper EP is not the best demonstration of what it's creator is capable of.","Oct 28, 2016"

Mojo,80,"Warm On A Cold Night is essentially a pick-up line delivered in Andys charmingly unfinished croak, wrapped in sensual synths and slick basslines.","Oct 28, 2016"

The Guardian,82,"Artistically speaking, Demon City represents a leap forward in terms of Cramptons musical growth. American Drift was like a sumptuous glass overflowing, but Demon City is a wonder of concision, with songs that mostly fall under four minutes.","Oct 28, 2016"
Clash Music,80,"Whatever's at the heart of these sonic fictions, it drove Crampton to reach for new audio possibilities, not for the sake of novelty but to keep pace with the futurity of her visions. It sets the album apart from other pieces of audio collage because it's not sound design for sound design's sake: it's what's required to bring the drama to life.","Oct 28, 2016"
Consequence of Sound,80,"By seamlessly incorporating disparate collaborations into the fabric of this City, Crampton summons a greater collective strength than theyve exhibited on their own--and implies that, going forward, her muse could lead her anywhere, with anyone.","Oct 28, 2016"

Record Collector,60,"At 20 tracks long, however, it takes some serious listening to get through the whole thing, and a sense of sag in the latter third threatens to overpower on the first few spins. Essentially, this flower could've used a little more judicious pruning.","Oct 21, 2016"

AllMusic,70,"If Craig can manage to maintain his unique delicacy of sound, while pushing his melodic capabilities, he could achieve something special. Yet, if he allows pop elements to take over, instead of remaining as hints and references, he risks becoming simply another producer penning groovy, soulless hits for electro-pop scenesters. In order to remain distinctive, Craig will need to keep the balance hes struck here firmly in mind.","Oct 14, 2016"

The Observer (UK),60,"In between more scattered wibblings, (sometimes overly) damaged yet lush textures abound on this long but often rather good and shoegazing-influenced record, the vocalists true worth finally being illustrated on the naked Purpose (Is No Country).","Oct 14, 2016"

PopMatters,83,"Cheetah is still his best release since his return to the music scene. If youre looking for something groundbreaking, youre probably going to be disappointed, but this is still one of 2016s best electronic releases, and a worthy addition to the Aphex Twin canon.","Oct 14, 2016"
Q Magazine,82,"Crucially, with his beats less busy, it has left James more room to focus on spine-tinglingly rich tunings and timbres. And thats where Cheetah really stands out: To sink into it, preferably on good headphones or better speakers, is to be immersed in woozy, viscous frequencies far more vivid than youll find almost anywhere else.","Oct 14, 2016"
Mojo,80,"Theres not a single weak track, so the bottom line is that if theres been a better EP released this year, I havent heard it.","Oct 14, 2016"
Uncut,78,"The record hews especially close to a strain of plush acid, albeit with Aphex Twin's inimitable charm. But a short change of pace arrives from the dissonant 'CHEETA1b ms800' and 'CHEETA2 ms800,' which seem to be brief tests of rich, textured patches from the Cheetah. These tracks complete a record that finds inspiration and style from obstacles and restrictions.","Oct 14, 2016"

The Line of Best Fit,70,"It's quite an enjoyable listen. It's all possibly about as boxed and pared down as Richard D James has sounded.","Oct 14, 2016"
AllMusic,70,"Cheetah is warm, rudimentary (lotsa 808s), and demurely catchy--making it the poppiest record of this career phase by default.","Oct 14, 2016"
Uncut,60,"Aphex Twin has made a good move here by giving a similar feel throughout the EP, but instead of having a few so-so tracks alienated by a standout one, the entire release ends up being fine but unremarkable, especially when pitted against the behemoths of his back catalogue.","Oct 14, 2016"
PopMatters,60,"The EP is fine, by all means, but it's definitely not the Aphex release to reach for if you're expecting to be challenged or blown away by something utterly unique or exciting.","Oct 14, 2016"
Under The Radar,60,"Cheetah isnt bad, but it could be the work of lesser producer.","Oct 14, 2016"

Clash Music,80,"Donna is eclectic, moving, emotive and true to Cassy's roots. Her vocals, which dominate the album, recall the same soulful edge of singer-songwriter Sade. The real triumph here, though, is the sense of creative freedom that pervades the album.","Oct 14, 2016"
Pitchfork,70,"The downside is that, from a compositional standpoint, [the cover of Prince's 'Strange Relationship] easily surpasses everything else on the album. Comparatively, the other tracks on which Britton's slightly spooky voice is heard are less songs than they are productions with vocals. Almost no living songwriter can be expected to contend with Prince, but the song's presence here is an ill fit.","Oct 14, 2016"
Consequence of Sound,65,"Props to Britton for trying out new templates--but shes on firmer ground when shes in her 4/4 comfort zone, and Donnas at its best when it plays to her emo-house strengths.","Oct 14, 2016"

The Guardian,80,"DJ-Kicks is essentially a peak-time mix of house and techno that would be devastating if played at any club, standing still and not cracking a smile would be basically impossible.

Pretty Much Amazing,68,"DJ-Kicks isn't the best mix Jackmaster's ever done, largely because his taste in new house and techno is less convincing than what's in his record collection at home. There are, however, flashes of brilliance that confirm his status as one of the most skilful and thrilling DJs working today.","Oct 14, 2016"

No Ripcord,80,"Bismillah and Karam add gentle layers of spiritual jazz and afrobeat to the mix.

The Line of Best Fit,80,"Turning moments into music is the next best thing, and something that Mount excelled at in the years after Nights Out as he became a more eclectic, emotive artist. Summer 08's exuberance and sophistication are a testament to those skills, as well as to music's power to define and evoke a period in time--and one of Metronomy's most enjoyable albums yet.","Oct 14, 2016"
AllMusic,80,"He knows how to fill a dance floor. But his music comes with the sharp awareness of how it feels to stand, alienated and feigning aloofness, on the sidelines.","Oct 14, 2016"

PopMatters,80,"Summer 08 may not have been designed to build on the success of Love Letters and The English Riviera, but it still very well may; it's every bit as resourceful, offbeat and pleasing as anything Mount has done to date.","Oct 14, 2016"

The Independent (UK),70,"Summer 08 is good work from Mount, and an album with its fair share of corking tracks.","Oct 14, 2016"
The Quietus,70,"The instrumental Summer Jam also seems a bit throwaway, and being the closing track also ensures that the album ends on a bit of a damp squib rather than a flourish.

Drowned In Sound,80,"Tooth, with its sharp title, minimalist drum attacks and hauntological synth textures, represents the antithesis of such plurality, reducing dance to its most antagonistic and unflinchingly bare-boned aesthetic and coming up with a new language from familiar idioms, sometimes from other genres.","Oct 14, 2016"

PopMatters,70,"Compared to the way more dynamic Quarter Over a Living Line, some of the tracks on this album have a maddening potential to them (the sequence Glassed/Cold Cain is my personal stress peak), which comes from such an extended use of repetition.

Clash Music,75,"Shadow's beats programming remains formidable, as he steers clear of standard bangers in favor of something far more difficult to pin down. This isn't an album built for dancing.

AllMusic,67,"The repetition of the word mambo over another messy beat fails to do much. Theres too much going on to really make much sense of whats happening. Shadow quickly makes up for that with two of the most alluring tracks on the record. Ashes To Oceans features British jazz composer and trumpeter Matthew Halsall, providing a gorgeous contribution to the already haunting composition. On Pitter Patter, rain-fall piano notes permeate the track while producer Bleep Bloop and Nite School Klik associate/trap producer G Jones give it an ethereal feel.","Oct 14, 2016"
Drowned In Sound,66,"Far from aiming for some grand unified statement, The Mountain Will Fall feels a lot more like a DJ set--a curated grab bag of ideas that overlap and collide, sometimes in unexpected ways.","Oct 14, 2016"

Pitchfork,60,"It broadly makes for a winning reboot, from the old-skool hip-hop stylings of The Sideshow and the urgency of Nobody Speak, a collaboration with Run the Jewels, to the more menacing atmosphere of Depth Charge and the jazz inflections of Ashes to Oceans. Its not without its longueurs, however.","Oct 14, 2016"
AllMusic,50,"There are a few tracks (including the two straight-ahead rap tunes and haunting closer Suicide Pact) where he does actually let the groove unfold naturally, but that just makes even more frustratingly clear how much better the rest of this record could be if only Shadow would just ease off on the tinkering and fidgeting.","Oct 14, 2016"
Exclaim,44,"Some of Davis's early records still sound exciting because of the raw talent and vision behind them, and because of the way he stitched together the threads of old songs into captivating new ones.

No Ripcord,80,"Warm Leatherette is often considered a rehearsal for Nightclubbing but in some ways its the most radical of the pair, because it unveiled to a shocked audience the new-look Jones, presented on the sleeve in stark black and white as a kind of sinister Pierrot by her partner Jean-Paul Goude.","Sep 30, 2016"

Pitchfork,81,"Many of the tracks on his last album felt like sketchesthe kernel of an idea, abandoned quickly. The same sensibility holds here, but even the simplest idea is stretched across a much bigger frame, to six or seven or even eight minutes. Thats important; you need the time to sink into these things. After a spell, you cant say whether you've been listening to a given piece for two or 20 minutes.","Sep 23, 2016"

Record Collector,70,"The tracks are neither buoyed by unimpeded uplift or grounded by posture-crushing gravity; theyre somewhere in the middle, suspended slightly off the earth but prevented from rocketing skyward. This is what makes Cutlers sound so distinct, here and elsewhere.","Sep 23, 2016"
Mojo,70,"So short and concentrated, the album feels like a style exercise rather than a major work, but it nonetheless finds Cutler refining his skills and presenting the best version of his 1992-via-2020 approach yet.","Sep 23, 2016"
Q Magazine,70,"Cutler has riddled these tracks with a rainbow of synth ripples, making Levitate stand out immediately as a Lone record, despite heavily harkening back to a bygone era.","Sep 23, 2016"

Uncut,69,"The first third is playful if not quite memorable. ... But as N swoops down, with its slow, throbbing bassline, primitive drum machine pattern, echoing chimes, and flecks of flamenco guitar, you wonder if Lissvik might have pulled a fast one and gone back into an old hard drive to plunder some old Studio session, so dead-on is the sound.","Sep 16, 2016"
PopMatters,60,"Bringing in a slew of analog instruments, mostly to give each track its own disposition, Lissvik pulls together swinging piano, shuffling guitar, drums and loads of modular synth lines, and though he does a great job of keeping the album instrumentally diverse, he falls into the same textural and spatial avenues throughout much of the album.","Sep 16, 2016"

Paste Magazine,68,"As far as home-listening goes, Alpha is too inflexible to give a dynamic front-to-back experience. But that's not surprising: Alpha was made with DJs in mind. And on that level, the music has plenty to offer.","Sep 16, 2016"
No Ripcord,61,"Tracks such as There Was a Button and Traanc are acceptable as minimal-house DJ tools, but as greater parts of a long-playing whole, they seem lost for a broader context--a context Dear previously had no trouble offering. Only at Alphas tail end does Audions (and Dears) personality assert itself.","Sep 16, 2016"

Mojo,80,"You nearly always know what you're going to get with Plaid albums, but equally to miss them, to pass them up, is akin to passing up on some of those curious pleasures that make life so enjoyable, whatever these might be. So, you know what you must do; get digging The Digging Remedy.","Sep 16, 2016"

Under The Radar,70,"At times a track will roll into monotony, sort of running in place, but such is the pitfall of electronic sequencing.

Resident Advisor,65,"The good news about The Digging Remedy is that its lovely and listenable for any longtime followers, or for anyone remotely interested in the kind of melodic IDM defined by this piece. However, it is neither an exciting deviation nor a refinement; as such, its really just more of an already-good thing, albeit packaged less delicately.","Sep 16, 2016"
DIY Magazine,60,"Its more of a reaffirmation of what Plaid have always been--dancing between the clever and the clever-clever, always remembering that you need to have gone clubbing to enjoy any post-club chill out.","Sep 16, 2016"

New Musical Express (NME),70,"It never gets boring, it moves quickly, and it often hits lofty heights where the melodies, music, voices, and beats all combine as one to do what the best dance music does: Transport the listener to a sweaty, uplifted dancefloor packed with like-minded revelers.","Sep 16, 2016"
Mojo,65,"Grecian Summer seems like a Hanging Gardens off-cut, all bouncy beats and twinkling synths, whilst Faraway Reach is a blissed-out, breezy tune with just the right amount of funk. These moments are, however, disappointingly few and far between.","Sep 16, 2016"

The Wire,80,"From massive, bashy beginnings, Congrats opens out into an album of very real, ripped-rule-book excitement; its exhausting and exhilarating and wonderful.","Sep 16, 2016"
Record Collector,75,"All of the songs (minus one useless interlude) had at least something worth returning to.","Sep 16, 2016"
Pretty Much Amazing,75,"Congrats is the welcome return of a foursome of dudes that are still plenty proficient at creating crooked, cock-eyed, almost-club jams (Acidic) and piling on swirling effects and rhythms to a critical mass without ever sounding like theyre losing control (Sabbatics).","Sep 16, 2016"
Pitchfork,70,"Overall, Congrats acts more as a proof-of-concept than as a proper successor to Latin.","Sep 16, 2016"
PopMatters,70,"Reiterating a few of the Tonebank-Rhythm-Ko-esque grooves that weve heard before, albeit with a darker, occasionally shoegazy approach this time.","Sep 16, 2016"
Resident Advisor,67,"While Holy Fuck once felt like an absolute anomaly, its interesting to see that their brand of electronic music has become something of a trope. Even more interesting, though, is whether theyll continue to push farther into dismantling that and forge into even newer territory. There are hints of it on Congrats, though thats balanced by the feeling of too easily slipping into a familiar groove.","Sep 16, 2016"
Consequence of Sound,66,"Congrats isnt incoherent in its diversity, it just never seems to build on itself--the record lacks a definitive peak, and most of the individual tracks tend to just state their main idea fairly early on.","Sep 16, 2016"
The Wire,60,"The buzz never quite lasts. Cuts such as 'Neon Dad' and 'Acidic' are less thriller, more filler; each is executed with admirable precision, but unable to reach the peak of cranium-dismantling album closer 'Crapture.'","Sep 16, 2016"

AllMusic,80,"GLADYB doesn't really deviate from the path that was laid down by previous albums Lucky Shiner and Half of Where You Live, but--perhaps even more impressively--it stays decidedly on it, rounding out a beautiful trilogy of semi-danceable, definitely nod-able records. It may even be his best.","Sep  9, 2016"
XLR8r,80,"Choppy beats and rhythms along with shuffling percussion helps create a feeling of urban movement and flux. There is a swagger to the songs that is hard to ignore--Panda has created the album that he has always hinted at.","Sep  9, 2016"
Mojo,80,"Executed with conviction and instilled with its spirited concept, Good Luck and Do Your Best is an excitingly off-beat take on a feel-good album. This is Gold Pandas most accomplished and adventurous work yet.","Sep  9, 2016"
Clash Music,80,"As with previous releases, Gold Panda blends repetition with rich sonic textures that are so diverse that they are almost tactile. This is one of 2016's best electronic albums so far, and it's difficult to see how it can be topped.","Sep  9, 2016"

XLR8r,74,"It sounds quite unlike any of the electronic music being made in 2016, and is refreshingly unfashionable in that way.","Sep  9, 2016"
Drowned In Sound,72,"2013's Half Of Where You Live was largely built around recordings made while traveling the world, including Japan, so what's unique about Good Luck is how it sounds less like a specific place than a flurry of memories made there.","Sep  9, 2016"

Record Collector,58,"Good Luck and Do Your Best is dull, an affair that lacks curiosity because the answers are in front of him. None of the production is outright bad, just done before by the likes of Four Tet, Nujabes, and John Talabot.","Sep  9, 2016"

Uncut,100,"Skin is brilliant across the board.","Sep  9, 2016"

Consequence of Sound,70,"While satisfying, the record could have used a bit more of that invention and risk.","Sep  9, 2016"
Pitchfork,70,"While so much EDM sounds the same right now, his tracks are thankfully hard to pigeonhole--as they weave industrial, deep house, dubstep, minimal and hip hop influences into a cohesive whole thats both danceable and perfect for sofa listening too.","Sep  9, 2016"
The Line of Best Fit,70,"If the burden on electronic producers is to establish personality beyond a dense network of light displays and computer processing, this album gets Flume halfway there: It shows him as unquestionably human (overeager, alternately flashy and timid, sometimes more in awe than in control), but still a bit faceless.","Sep  9, 2016"
Drowned In Sound,67,"Skin is the sound of Flume reaching for great heights and almost grasping what he seeks there.","Sep  9, 2016"
AllMusic,64,"[Wall Fuck is] short and snappy, gone too fast in an album that couldve been streamlined to let moments like it shine. But maybe its the sound of floodgates opening.","Sep  9, 2016"

The Observer (UK),80,"This mischievous ethos has rarely been better displayed than on this often uneasy listening set from Berlin-based, old-school activist DJs Graef and Astro who, after name-making solo careers, came together last year to form their Money $ex imprint as a platform for their woozy marriages of obscure vinyl sensibility and startling aural foraging.","Sep  9, 2016"
Boston Globe,80,"On occasion the constantly shifting patterns can get a bit itchy and unsettling, but for the most part its a joyful creation.","Sep  9, 2016"
DIY Magazine,80,"These are their beloved records, guzzled up, internalized, and regurgitated in new unrecognizable forms; music of the past as perceived by modern minds; an even balance between tight live instrumentation and charming studio nous.

Clash Music,60,"Folding Time serves as a stopgap for an aging sound without a firm grasp on its bearings. Should Sepalcure continue writing from their fixed point, they'll have to project further and further from its origin.","Sep  2, 2016"

The Wire,77,"Despite Dms preference for playing tracks pretty much all the way through--which suggests an infectious, wide-eyed passion for the music that fits into his mind-control powers--the mix is properly appreciated as a whole.","Sep  2, 2016"
Dusted Magazine,74,"That final third of DJ-Kicks might not be its strongest section but it no less feels like the most emblematic of Riddick's timeless appeal--connecting funk's past, present and future with an unbreakable thread of authenticity and positivity.","Sep  2, 2016"
XLR8r,70,"The depth of these cuts will depend on your familiarity with electro-funk and its history, but there should be enough here to satisfy even the most literate of fans, and for newcomers to Dm's sound, it's a fine primer.","Sep  2, 2016"
Exclaim,60,"While Dm-Funks singles and albums have established him as funks most forward thinking artist, his DJ sets have concentrated on classic 80s boogie gems. His entry into DJ Kicks long-running mix series is less rigidly formatted.","Sep  2, 2016"

Drowned In Sound,60,"It seems a blinkered record, which can be admired for its defiantly non-commercial stance. It wont win Fearless any new fans, and may distance Death In Vegas into more of a cult concern. All well and good if thats the intent; otherwise, perhaps its time to draw the curtains, get some vitamin D and thumb through that guest vocalist address book.","Aug 26, 2016"

PopMatters,85,"Thats just what this albums got. A heart. Mathmatical, mechanical parts that once evoked landscapes, snowscapes, a view frozen in time now evoke emotions and memories.

Consequence of Sound,60,"As far as Pantha du Prince standards go, those expecting bangers will find that this is a slower paced, subtler, more meticulously detailed album than Black Noise. Yet for every dark, dreary, wintery moment, theres more than enough of luxurious, melodic techno bliss to make up for it.","Aug 26, 2016"
Pitchfork,60,"Pantha Du Prince describes The Triad as 'about more human ways of interacting... about meeting up and jamming' and, in many ways, it does resemble something close to a jam session where unpolished but great ideas are worked out to be developed more fully later.","Aug 26, 2016"
The Line of Best Fit,60,"While this first solo album in six years is elevating, and intricate in its elegance and rhythmic propulsions, it remains uncluttered by the chaos of true, visceral emotion.","Aug 26, 2016"
Drowned In Sound,58,"Most of The Triad lacks darkness or tension, which results in a lack of depth and contrast.","Aug 26, 2016"
Mojo,50,"At over an hour long with just 10 tracks, The Triad is built from moments of refined beauty stretched across a frame that might be just too big, its many slow moments shrouded behind gradual shifts in its dense fog of ambient noise.","Aug 26, 2016"

The Observer (UK),80,"Earrings Off! is undoubtedly a brave, intriguing release, and should cement Adult Jazz as a band you really cant afford to ignore.","Aug 19, 2016"
Mixmag,80,"Earrings Off! is an album that demands multiple listens and gets better with each one.","Aug 19, 2016"
Resident Advisor,70,"When Earrings Off! is good, its very, very good. When its not so good, it sounds too much like forced experimentation.","Aug 19, 2016"
PopMatters,70,"Earrings Off! is made up of uncompromising stuff that may take some adjusting to, but willing ears will find articulate, distinctive musicality that rewards repeat listens. It might even provide an unexpected earworm or two.","Aug 19, 2016"
DIY Magazine,67,"Even with misgivings about the lack of length and focus, this mini-LP makes fairly clear that Adult Jazz are in a transitional state. Earrings Off! is too small to be called a sophomore slump, and it introduces new elements to the bands repertoire that could easily play well with the best aspects of Gist Is.","Aug 19, 2016"
The Independent (UK),60,"Earrings Off! is filled with these sorts of growing pains, ones that hopefully point to brighter pastures sometime soon for this promising band.","Aug 19, 2016"
Slant Magazine,60,"Earrings Off! is as much art project as it is pop album, though, and three of these seven tracks are brief instrumentals that dont attempt to soften their avant ambitions.","Aug 19, 2016"
New Musical Express (NME),40,"Earrings Off! also features three instrumental tracks, but none of these feel like they add anything to the experience of the album, or its central themes.","Aug 19, 2016"

Uncut,60,"Despite its strokes of mass appeal, Mayday offers not only a taste of the quintessential Boys Noize sound, but also some fresh novelty that devotees can easily appreciate.","Aug 19, 2016"
AllMusic,60,"Much of the album has the subtlety of being trapped inside a panic alarm.","Aug 19, 2016"

Dusted Magazine,82,"Four hours of dense, bewildering and occasionally fun electronic music, elseq 1-5 is a logical next step into the unknown for two pioneers.","Aug 19, 2016"

The Observer (UK),80,"Each track on Under The Sun has its own unique, haunting spirit, lingering long after the final note decays. [Jun 2016, p.95]","Aug 19, 2016"
Clash Music,80,"This tasteful mix of analogue keys and distorted drum machines is precisely what we've come to expect from Pritchard. It's when he wanders off-piste with Bibio, Thom Yorke and Linda Perhacs that the record comes alive, and these instrumental tracks then play a vital supporting role. [Jun 2016, p.80]","Aug 19, 2016"
AllMusic,76,"Deeply atmospheric and richly impressionistic, Under the Sun is an easy album to disappear into.","Aug 19, 2016"
Resident Advisor,72,"Under The Sun isn't the major departure that it seems on the surface, but rather a pleasant detour through mythical, imagined landscapes.","Aug 19, 2016"
Uncut,70,"While Under The Sun isnt quite as strong as its monumental predecessor 76:14, Pritchard still has an eye for coaxing out the astoundingly beautiful from cold electronics.","Aug 19, 2016"
Drowned In Sound,60,"It's a sinuous and, at times, difficult listen, but these songs are supple enough to sink into, given space and the necessary inclination. It's dance music, sure, just not as we know it.","Aug 19, 2016"
The Independent (UK),60,"It's an album that will send you to sleep, and to dreams of another dimension. [Jul 2016, p.114]","Aug 19, 2016"

Record Collector,90,"She and Greenspan refract techno-pop in their own way while binding additional forms of electronic post-disco that cross four decades, from boogie to juke.","Aug 19, 2016"
Pitchfork,90,"On Oh No, Jessy Lanza reveals a range of new emotions, influences and styles, further establishing a distinctive sound that blurs the lines even more between pop and club music.","Aug 19, 2016"
The Quietus,90,"Lanza, the antithesis of the ululating, overwrought antics of the X Factor school, has an arsenal of talents that puts her in a league of her own. Shes very much for real.","Aug 19, 2016"
Uncut,80,"For all the deft production touches, it's Lanza's lost-on-the-dancefloor persona, at once sensuous and mysterious, which supplies the magic touch. [Jul 2016, p.109]","Aug 19, 2016"
Clash Music,80,"A more exuberant sophomore effort that synthesises the techno-pop of Yellow Magic Orchestra and the electro-R&B of '80s hitmakers like Midnight Star. [Jul 2016, p.75]","Aug 19, 2016"
PopMatters,80,"Oh No aims for pop and hits it squarely.","Aug 19, 2016"
Mixmag,80,"Thematically the songs stick to the familiar pop terrain of love--the least adventurous thing about them--but Oh No nonetheless makes a convincing case for broadening the term 'pop star' beyond the glamazons.","Aug 19, 2016"
Clash Music,80,"Seemingly existing on a higher plane, this feels like upended R&B beamed down from outer space, encapsulating everything from the smoothness of Sade to the edginess of Aaliyah.","Aug 19, 2016"
Drowned In Sound,80,"Driven by crispy drum machines and shimmering synths, Lanzas second full-length Hyperdub offering is instantly more direct and relatable than its predecessor; cloudy reverb is replaced by sheeny production.","Aug 19, 2016"
AllMusic,80,"At times, the production can be overly fussy (see Going Somewhere), but tracks such as VV Violence (squelchy electro-funk by way of girlish electroclash) and Never Enough (a nod to smooth house dude Morgan Geist) demonstrate their ability to team that experimentalism with peak-time danceability. There could be a bona fide pop star in Jessy Lanza yet.","Aug 19, 2016"
Resident Advisor,80,"Wrapped in a overwhelming number of influences, Oh No vaults across an infinity of cultural milieus to find itself.","Aug 19, 2016"
The Quietus,80,"What this sense of apparent introversion leads to, however, is anything but a soft or slow record. On the contrary; Oh No often grooves harder and faster than Pull My Hair Back, with Lanzas voice still invoking early Madonna and Cyndi Lauper.","Aug 19, 2016"
Clash Music,80,"Its a testament to the extraordinary breadth of Oh No, as Lanza metamorphosizes from an intriguing curiosity to a formidable contender in contemporary electronic music.","Aug 19, 2016"
Pitchfork,79,"Oh No is a gorgeous and deadly pop music manifesto that proves yet again the sad girls are not vulnerable and silent subjects.","Aug 19, 2016"
AllMusic,76,"Oh No is an inventive and enjoyable pop record that only falls short of Lanza's own standards.","Aug 19, 2016"
Under The Radar,75,"Lanza's second album is brief, bright and sophisticated, and while it doesn't push any boundaries or cross borders/genres as much or as often as a fan might hope, it does deliver on the sonic and melodic promise of her debut and offer that chance of a wider audience that has been promised since her first appearance.","Aug 19, 2016"
Pitchfork,75,"Songs on Oh No never outright fail, but they dont all inspire the same level of intrigue and enthusiasm. There are moments when Lanza sings entirely in falsetto over an ambient afterglow where you will get FKA Twigs deja vu.","Aug 19, 2016"
Consequence of Sound,70,"It may be true that Oh No doesnt quite match the mystery or depth of her debut--its all very transparent and above the surface in comparison--but it offers enough proof that the overt, more soulful qualities demonstrated on this album should serve her well for some time yet.","Aug 19, 2016"
Exclaim,67,"While its tempting to peg this as a breakthrough, it feels and sounds more like an expertly crafted transitional album. Oh No acts as a refinement of Lanzas previous sound while gently nudging pop as a whole into a more complex and subtle future.","Aug 19, 2016"
Record Collector,60,"Her follow-up seems brasher, more memorable yet less substantial, lacking the eeriness that made her last work so compelling.","Aug 19, 2016"
Drowned In Sound,60,"Oh No doesnt quite signal a reinvention for Lanza, but a move towards one end of her capabilities, one which consistently brings excitement, energy and openings for new paths for her to head down.","Aug 19, 2016"

AllMusic,90,"Even though there are eight months left in 2016, its impossible to imagine any album having nearly as much personality, experimentation, or superb songs as Fool does, and will certainly be one of the best albums to come down the pipeline this year.","Aug 19, 2016"
Pitchfork,90,"The musicianship of the guest artists is impressive, and Jameszoo's interpretations of their work are startlingly creative. The whole package is likely to be one of the year's best, and certainly one of its most original.","Aug 19, 2016"
The Quietus,80,"Fool is the stunning debut from a young Dutch producer. [Jun 2016, p.53]","Aug 19, 2016"
The Wire,80,"By the spangled keyboards, spectral funk and squalling sax of closing pair Toots and Teeth, Van Dinther has successfully forged his own new personal universe, showing jazzs original questing spirit still alive, kicking and able to make new sonic waves.","Aug 19, 2016"
Tiny Mix Tapes,80,"Fool is the product of a powerful imagination, the kind of mind that's unburdened by assumptions and orthodoxies.","Aug 19, 2016"
Pitchfork,70,"It's not easy to grasp at first, but it reveals van Dinther as a restless creative spirit, and seems to only hint at the directions his artistic career could take in the future.","Aug 19, 2016"
No Ripcord,69,"Jameszoo's work is strongest when he tones down the overt jazz and instead parses the genre for specific sounds and ideas to embellish his electronic experimentations.","Aug 19, 2016"
The Quietus,67,"While the vast majority of the album serves its purpose as a re-education of sorts between Van Dither and the listener, these tracks ['Wrong,' 'Nail (Skit),' 'Crumble,' and 'Toots'] drag with self-satisfying excess.","Aug 19, 2016"

Exclaim,70,"Some stretches of the album may be a little too sleepy and subdued, with songs bleeding together in a hypnotic haze. Nonetheless, refreshingly void of aggression or any deliberate tension, Cloud Nine comforts with its positivity and charm.","Aug 12, 2016"
Resident Advisor,60,"The narrow emotional and musical range suggests Kygo doesn't have unexplored depths, but he doesn't need them. [#361, p.111]","Aug 12, 2016"
Mixmag,60,"Cloud Nine could certainly do with a few more musical ideas, but this shouldnt trouble Kygo unduly--after all, the same problem never held back David Guetta and Calvin Harris.","Aug 12, 2016"
Pitchfork,60,"His debut album, Cloud Nine, is naturally very same-y--deep house wasting away in Margaritaville--but unfailingly gorgeous.","Aug 12, 2016"
PopMatters,50,"Hes still figuring out the transition out of his remix artist phase, but enough works on his debut to show that theres hope for the future.","Aug 12, 2016"
Resident Advisor,20,"The lyrics are as earnest and emotionally inarticulate as a 19-year-old on Tinder. Well, this is pop, where cliche can be transcendent, but these joyless songs are chemically castrated of any passion or sexuality.","Aug 12, 2016"

Exclaim,80,"Initially foreboding, its laminar abstractions give way to the stealthy textural seductions of centrepiece 'Line Angel,' where shards of electronic glass penetrate a wavering organ drift, and the choral minimalism of closer, 'MFBK.' [Jun 2016, p.78]","Aug 12, 2016"
Uncut,76,"It's more about repetition than surprise, meditation than hyperactivity. Many tracks start slowly and quietly, and some hold entirely to that restraint.","Aug 12, 2016"
The Guardian,72,"Get In was recorded last year, but it sounds like it could have been made at any time over the intervening decade.","Aug 12, 2016"
AllMusic,70,"Get In finds Rehberg stretching the Pita sound into more graceful territory, but he hasn't lost his flair for the unexpected that made his work during the '90s and 2000s so visionary.","Aug 12, 2016"
The 405,60,"A tad less confrontational than previous Pita releases but no less powerful. [Aug 2016, p.97]","Aug 12, 2016"

Exclaim,90,"From where were standing, this is the debut album of the year.","Aug  5, 2016"
Mixmag,84,"He seems to have complete control over the proverbial dance floor, switching up tempos to match the crowds mood throughout the 15-track album; this prevents 99.9% from feeling bloated and is yet another reason Kaytranadas debut album is a resounding success.","Aug  5, 2016"
Uncut,84,"99.9% is an assertion of identity and a rejection of identity and a whole lot of other things all at once, and provides some of the most incredible music of the year all the same. If this is the sound of hip-hop today, were in a good place.","Aug  5, 2016"
AllMusic,83,"The most critical takeaway is how nuanced every single track is on behalf of Kaytranadas unparalleled attention to and manipulation of detail.","Aug  5, 2016"
Clash Music,83,"Whether working in strands of hip-hop, house, funk, or whatever next might come to mind, theres something inherently glowing about his beats. All those genres are jammed together into a single album, just like they are within Celestin; he finds joy and fun in them all.","Aug  5, 2016"
Resident Advisor,80,"The albums title suggests something close to perfection, and 99.9% isnt too far from being the ideal electronic record.","Aug  5, 2016"

The 405,80,"His records name is meant to suggest a certain sense of incompleteness, but its one of the most well-edited, coherent debuts to emerge in recent memory.","Aug  5, 2016"
Mojo,80,"The LPs sunset pastels and recurring elastic bass lines at times threaten to rob the tracks of their singularities. But 99.9% is a success because Kaytranada fosters an environment where every guest shines.","Aug  5, 2016"
PopMatters,80,"Combined with beats seemingly tailored for each voice, the album could have resembled a disorderly production showcase, yet Celestin applies his experience as a deeply knowledgeable selector to stitch it all together with few obvious seams. He excels most at bold modern boogie with spring-loaded drums, zip-and-glide basslines, and radiant keyboards.","Aug  5, 2016"
Under The Radar,80,"As a calling card, it's as close to perfection as the title suggests. [Jul 2016, p.109]","Aug  5, 2016"
Uncut,80,"The albums title refers to the feeling of never being quite done, but 99.9% oozes poise and confidence.","Aug  5, 2016"
AllMusic,80,"99% is a brilliant, well-realized combination of styles, with more than its fair share of memorable and addictive songs.","Aug  5, 2016"
Magnet,80,"Taking all of 99.9% into account, it's really no wonder that Kaytranada has become one of the most sought-after producers these days. This will surely mark yet another, even weightier, launchpad for Kaytranada to head skyward, out towards that much-fabled 100%.","Aug  5, 2016"
Pitchfork,80,"As much as Kaytranada seems to be referencing genre staples and styles, his constant flights of rhythmic fancy make his music seem genre-averse. And when he connects with a vocalist or drummer who shares that sensibility, 99.9% really glows.","Aug  5, 2016"
Record Collector,70,"For a debut album from such a young artist, 99.9% is remarkably self-assured. It sets up Celestin as someone carving out his niche.","Aug  5, 2016"
Clash Music,70,"To the gustatory synesthete, listening to Kaytranada's music is probably the equivalent of sucking on a pack of Starburst where all the flavours are orange: refreshing at first, if not a bit sickly in the end.","Aug  5, 2016"
Q Magazine,60,"At 15 tracks, Kaytranada couldve easily cut out about three of the lesser songs here and had a better album.","Aug  5, 2016"
Exclaim,60,"Its hard to keep up, then--but worth it.","Aug  5, 2016"
Resident Advisor,60,"Collaborations here, there and everywhere, for the most part Kaytranada pulls the strings. But it is a work that threatens to find him in the shadows, leaving the spotlight to bigger names.","Aug  5, 2016"

Exclaim,80,"On this companion piece he teams up with the likes of Jeff Mills, the Orb, Yello and Sebastien Tellier, and again seems energised and inspired by the collaborative process.","Aug  5, 2016"

Resident Advisor,60,"As with the first volume of Electronica, the second is commendable for its scope and its attempt to bridge several generations of electronic music, but as a listening experience, it requires a fair amount of cherry-picking.","Aug  5, 2016"
Clash Music,49,"One senses a massively missed opportunity, a chance for exploration blown by Jarre's insatiable need to make everything bigger, more impressive.","Aug  5, 2016"
Mixmag,40,"It's all a bit of a mess, with even more arresting efforts--Julia Holter's seraphic turn on These Creatures and Swipe To The Right's giddy Cyndi Lauper-assisted disco--sounding like they belong on different albums. [Jul 2016, p.109]","Aug  5, 2016"

PopMatters,80,"The mix is full of voices, all snipped up in fragments or rendered as blurred tones. The results lends his exquisite productions a haunting emotional resonance. [#361, p.115]","Aug  5, 2016"
Pitchfork,80,"Journeying and introspective, U pieces together a narrative that reflects on a past relationship; sculpting electronica, garage and piano together effortlessly.","Aug  5, 2016"

Drowned In Sound,91,"At 17 songs in 76 minutes, Colour is Blakes longest album yet and with so much talent aiding the songwriter, it can feel belabored. But then there are stunners like f.o.r.e.v.e.r. and the title track.","Aug  5, 2016"
musicOMH.com,91,"As with anyone complaining of love lost between pleas for it to return, it begins to become tiresome  no matter how smooth your voice may be.

DIY Magazine,90,"From its weighty subject matter to its incredibly nuanced production, The Colour in Anything is not only Blake at his best, but also his most personal. Blake's expanded his both his heart and his process here, making music with others outside of his laptop to demonstrate the growth that had led to this brilliant, fulfilling work.","Aug  5, 2016"
NOW Magazine,85,"It's an introspective, at times hesitant collection yet in the way most introverts allow themselves to relax within company, the more time you invest in The Colour In Anything the more readily you will discover its qualities.","Aug  5, 2016"

PopMatters,80,"Its not a perfect album--like so many, at 17 tracks its way too long, and theres too little variation in tempo and mood--but its yet another confirmation of what can be achieved when subtlety and sensitivity are the driving forces.","Aug  5, 2016"
Tiny Mix Tapes,80,"The growth is more suggestive than pronounced, and is found in the details.","Aug  5, 2016"

Under The Radar,80,"Features Blake's richest and most emotionally resonant work yet.","Aug  5, 2016"
Record Collector,80,"[Blake's vocal is] magical in its evocative powers, and like Arthur Russell he can summon a sort of joyful sadness that seems to transcend the song itself. It means this album of digital anxiety and millennial unease is wrapped in something that feels both toweringly accomplished and heart-wrenchingly frail--and for that reason it should be treasured.","Aug  5, 2016"

The Guardian,70,"Blake's third album (all 76 minutes of it) reaches back to the abstract electronics and agile, brittle beats of his early EPs while pushing his songwriting towards new levels of sad urgent grandeur.

The Observer (UK),80,"The Ship is a memorial to and meditation on history and human foibles. Just as importantly, it places an exclamation point on Eno's career as curiosity, experimentation, chance, and form gel; his relentless sense of adventure remains undiminished by time.","Aug  5, 2016"

The Wire,67,"Basically, this particular ambient music doesnt lend much intellectual export or posterity that Eno so often claims to pursue. (Being slower isnt necessarily a sign of intellectual maturity.) His approach may show it, but thats his prerogative. Nothing wrong with staying in a mood, but this mood--whatever it is--sounds pretty played-out to me.","Aug  5, 2016"
Clash Music,67,"The Ship finds Enos music again foregoing the linear conventions of music and creating a kind of shapeless yet directed sound experience instead. More than that, the album is one in a long series of evidences that Enos limitations remain as near mythic as the man himself.","Aug  5, 2016"
Resident Advisor,60,"If you can get past the haughty lyrics on 'Fickle Sun (ii),' for instance, then its minimalist piano notes will surely impress. And yet, even that song's musicianship sounds downright conventional compared to preceding tracks 'Fickle Sun (i)' and opening track 'The Ship,' a 21-minute composition that begins with solemn synth moans like a distant vessel's horn.","Aug  5, 2016"
Mojo,60,"At 21 minutes long it could do with a trim, but the closing part, a cover of the Velvet Undergrounds Im Set Free, shows that Eno remains one of the great shape shifters.","Aug  5, 2016"
Clash Music,60,"The Ship sees Eno try his hand with the darker, cinematic side of minimal, and for the most part it works. The melancholic catalysts for the record (The First World War and the sinking of the Titanic) don't transcend quite as powerfully as they could have, though.","Aug  5, 2016"

The Observer (UK),81,"Despite the omission of obvious classics like Warm Leatherette or Fad Gadgets Rickys Hand (presumably because the Mute label archive was off-limits to the compiler) Close To the Noise Floor provides a fascinating overview of the formative years of British home-studio electronica: groups who were precursors in spirit, if not direct lineage, to the techno and IDM artists of the 90s.

AllMusic,80,"On its own, Yoyogi Park is a highly engrossing record of dream-like dancefloor sounds, but when sat next to Until Then, Goodbye and A Day In The Life, its an intelligent melding of its predecessors and exemplary final chapter.","Jul 22, 2016"

The Line of Best Fit,80,"Fitzpatrick latterly allows breathing space by lessening the intensity to a measly 85% or so; the beats keep rolling to a ubiquitous clatter of hi-hats until youre flintstoning your dancing shoes and moving Zombie-like to the less than subliminal command of Session Restores Speak Out.","Jul 22, 2016"
Mixmag,66,"Recorded in one take, fabric 87 captures the peak-time spirit of fabric's Room 2, and showcases exclusive edits from the DJ and remixes of currently boxfresh tracks like 'Lolly Pop' by Reset Robot.

The Guardian,80,"Too Many Voices is everything but a claustrophobic piece of sonic art. On the contrary, this is Stott at his best, a composer whose futuristic music is well rooted in todays world, one that is badly connected to material reality, without a locus, with an idea of time that is flexible, adaptable.","Jul 22, 2016"
Resident Advisor,80,"These processes are slow, sometimes painful and on multiple scales, but with each track and each album, the producer is changing our understanding of sound, data, memory and our own bodies in musical space. [Jun 2016, p.56]","Jul 22, 2016"
PopMatters,80,"Stott again collaborates with opera singer Alison Skidmore on decaying digital laments, warped twilight anthems and claustrophobic club bangers; stuttering songs of mourning for 21st century club culture. [Jul 2016, p.93]","Jul 22, 2016"
Drowned In Sound,80,"Like his peers and predecessors, he utilized vocals to elevate his shuddering half-time low-end above mere physical and intellectual impact--and into the listeners emotional realm. One listen into Stotts roomy fourth LP, Too Many Voices, and its clear thats exactly what hes going for.","Jul 22, 2016"
Exclaim,80,"Odd as it seems, the majority of the track titles resemble those of an R&B release. That's far from the only feature in support of the notion that Too Many Voices is Stott's brightest and most open-hearted work.","Jul 22, 2016"
PopMatters,80,"Too Many Voices is a breath of fresh air for anyone who found Faith overwhelmingly claustrophobic.","Jul 22, 2016"

Pitchfork,71,"Theres plenty of low and high end, but none of the gray in-between. It makes for an album that sounds more like backing tracks missing the singer and the song to complete them. If anything, Too Many Voices sounds like it has too few.","Jul 22, 2016"

The Guardian,80,"It is delicately shaded and tells us more of her hopes, dreams, fears and feelings than any interview ever could.

Sputnikmusic,60,"Honey suffers when its producers smooth out their rougher edges to accommodate Katys chart-star status.","Jul 15, 2016"
AllMusic,60,"The narrative she introduced with her first single Katy on a Mission--the story of a prospective dancefloor tryst--still dominates, and its a subject that barely contains the emotional mileage to sustain a single song, let alone a whole body of work.

The Wire,50,"Honey nonetheless comes across as an attention-grabbing experiment more than it does a third proper full-length.","Jul 15, 2016"
Mojo,50,"If it were not for Katy's distinctive voice--which she gloriously wields with an Aguilera-like ferocity during the last forty seconds or so of each track--Honey would not survive its own sweetness. At certain moments, however, the energies between Katy and the producers mesh just right, resulting in alchemic varieties of urban pop that glow brighter after each listen.","Jul 15, 2016"
Uncut,50,"Honey, when it works at least, is the sound of piecing together the night before: a love letter to not making it home, to the Tequila salt still stuck to your hand, to hands brushing under the cover of the smoke machine. Unfortunately, half of the time, it says precisely nothing and if that unquestionable potential is to be realised, Kathleen Brien has to make a choice.","Jul 15, 2016"
Pitchfork,50,"With nearly 20 production collaborators, the record has plenty of invention--and way too many cooks in the kitchen. ... [A] busy, unfocused record.","Jul 15, 2016"
Resident Advisor,30,"Katy Bs stultifying lyrics, paired with an EMI-sponsored coterie of established DJs, producers, and vocalists, surgically selected as if delegates of their respective niches, evince only the sound of the culture industry at work.","Jul 15, 2016"

Mixmag,80,"Left to his own devices, Bates's skittering effects and big, cavernous soundscapes can leave a metallic aftertaste like a mouthful of antibiotics, but the album's female guests--including Norwegian singer-songwriter Susanne Sundfr--provide the blood for Trgame Tierra's big, beating heart.","Jul  8, 2016"
Under The Radar,80,"It is chocked full of majestic pop hooks, but these are offset by ad-hoc rhythms and synths. Trgame Tierra is a remarkable album, but youve got to give it a chance.","Jul  8, 2016"
Q Magazine,50,"Bates sounds separate from Gibbs; their aural love affair falls flat. Bates will have to soldier on behind Big Black Delta, and hopefully with more time and experience he can break through and deliver the kind of emotional overtures hes only just hinted at.","Jul  8, 2016"
AllMusic,47,"On Trgame Tierra, Bates is both audacious and original, two qualities that are hard to fault. But in the absence of focus, listening to Trgame Tierra can feel like looking for dinner in a candy store: there's a lot of brightly-colored packaging to take in but not much you can really sink your teeth into.","Jul  8, 2016"

Clash Music,60,"Plenty of highlights for fans of minimalism can be found here--choose, for instance, from the frosty, shimmering synth and compelling tempo of Scido, or the deliciously dark, skittish Sleep Chamber. There's a slight hiccup with Balance, which has a throwaway feel, and Some Cats is an unremarkable album midpoint, but Kowton's maturity rears its reliable head again amongst Loops 1's spare arrangement, and Shots Fired is a trancey album closer.","Jul  8, 2016"

The Guardian,80,"With Lost Themes II, John Carpenter and band have delivered an album that not only stands up to its predecessor, but surpasses it. In addition to eerie atmospherics, the album is laden with addictive grooves, and feels sharper.","Jul  8, 2016"

Consequence of Sound,60,"On the opening Distant Dream, where a nagging, urgent keyboard line recalls classic Halloween-era Carpenter, until the creepy effect is undermined by some big, thumping power-drums that come off as more dated than retro.

AllMusic,80,"It's almost as if 1994's excellent, transitional Split and 1996's career peak Lovelife didn't exist. When the songs are this good, though, there should be little room for complaint.","Jul  8, 2016"
Q Magazine,80,"Whats most impressive about the Blind Spot EP is not only how deftly Lush have mined the sound that made them a real treasure in the first place, but that theyve matured without sounding tired, cash-in or merely nostalgic.","Jul  8, 2016"
Boston Globe,76,"If theres a weakness with Blind Spot it might simply be its brevity, or perhaps the marked absence of the kind of swaggering sonic guitar bombast the band unleashed in old songs like Sweetness and Light or Superblast!. Regardless, Blind Spot feels like an assured--albeit somewhat tentativeway for the band to dip their toes back in the water","Jul  8, 2016"
XLR8r,75,"Blind Spot sounds like the band hasn't missed a step since 1998. [No. 131, p.59]","Jul  8, 2016"

NOW Magazine,70,"Overall, Blind Spot works well on many levels. It shows the bandmembers aren't just exercising their nostalgic muscles while looking for a quick buck. It shows they are still capable of writing and recording very Lush-sounding music.","Jul  8, 2016"
Resident Advisor,60,"Romance remains their core theme, although Rosebud strikes out for the harsher terrain of thoughtless cruelty.","Jul  8, 2016"

The Guardian,80,"Including essential 70s albums like Zuckerzeit, Sowiesoso and two classic Eno collaborations, this killer collection shows Cluster refining its minimalist, electro-acoustic, programmed, studio-pop improvisations in urban and rural environs. [No. 131, p.53]","Jul  5, 2016"

AllMusic,80,"Material is the black celebration that Depeche Mode foresaw, sparkling party music for the downcast masses.","Jul  1, 2016"

The Line of Best Fit,85,"Through examples of sappy balladry, daytime TV and B-movie theme music, and bubblegum pop disco recreations, Gonzalez indulges in an oft-disavowed musical zeitgeist, imbuing it with the substance it always seemed to be missing.","Jun 24, 2016"

Pitchfork,70,"The result is less serious than his last release--the kind of thing we might hear back from aliens in response to radio waves that escaped our stratosphere long ago.","Jun 24, 2016"
Record Collector,70,"With Junk, Gonzalez has taken M83 into a whole new galaxy that is just as ambitious and starry-eyed as everything that came before it.","Jun 24, 2016"
Mojo,70,"Once Gonzalez has had his fun and begins to settle in to the ways of the old M83, but with a bit of a pop sheen to it, is when Junk works best. Its just a shame you have to flick through the channels to find the gold.","Jun 24, 2016"
Tiny Mix Tapes,68,"In the end, though, its that feeling of disposability that makes the albums title resonate more pointedly in the wrong way.","Jun 24, 2016"

Uncut,50,"Junk, M83's seventh studio album, sounds chintzy--a bubble-gum snyth-pop album that indulges Gonzalez's love of decades-old TV soundtracks, hair-metal guitar solos and kitschy pop songs.","Jun 24, 2016"
Spin,40,"Particularly bad is For The Kids, which could come straight from an amateur production of High School Musical (complete with repellent husky spoken-word middle eight), while the just up-to-scratch Beck track, Time Wind, and his presence on the record as a whole, only really serves to illustrate how poor the songs now are.","Jun 24, 2016"
AllMusic,40,"Gonzalez's more sincere side peeks through in moody, orchestral tracks like 'Solitude,' and the harmonica-heavy ballad, 'Sunday Night 1987.' Still, as its title implies, Junk leans too heavily on the quirks from the past, rife with the least flattering odds and ends of a time long gone.","Jun 24, 2016"
Rolling Stone,40,"Messy, complicated, capable of star turns, its clearly a record Gonzalez needed to get out of his system.","Jun 24, 2016"

Resident Advisor,90,"Love Streams is always on the move. Its alive and constantly evolving: a slippery beast of a record that you can try and get a hold of, but thankfully you probably never will.","Jun 24, 2016"
Pitchfork,82,"There's not a lot of forward motion here; motifs and timbres repeat across the record, and while many tracks flow seamlessly from one to the next, his open-ended constructions give the album a rewardingly meandering feel.","Jun 24, 2016"
Clash Music,80,"The sum of these parts is utterly energising.","Jun 24, 2016"
Exclaim,80,"Through tackling the repercussions of vocal processing and by demonstrating some of the most profound uses of it, Love Streams gives credence to the act in a way that vilifies the most obscure uses of it, even when the end results yield little more than the evaporated phantoms that we continue to chase in our everyday lives.","Jun 24, 2016"
The A.V. Club,80,"Its another landmark release for this deceptively versatile and forward-thinking artist, and perhaps, just perhaps, his most effective album to date.","Jun 24, 2016"

musicOMH.com,80,"Love Streams is easily Hecker's most accessible work to date, yet it's also one of his most challenging, as it finds him pushing his sound into new directions while he explores the possibilities of the human voice.","Jun 24, 2016"
Boston Globe,80,"It works on a purely instinctual, emotional level. It feels like music aimed at the gut, rather than the head, which might explain its burgeoning appeal. In the best possible way, Love Streams is a draining listen.","Jun 24, 2016"
Chicago Tribune,80,"Less reliant on theory or process, Love Streams is a testament to Heckers innate musical sense of direction.","Jun 24, 2016"
The Wire,80,"It takes a few listens to even begin to peel back its multi-layered complexity. Its a triumph, though: a dense, paranoid and phenomenally pretty exploration of post-millennial wonder thatll keep you coming back, even as it fills the pit of your stomach with dread.","Jun 24, 2016"

The Line of Best Fit,75,"Love Streams is far from Heckers best release. But its a promising development in his career, in that it proves not only that Hecker hasnt run out of ideas but that hes still bursting with them.","Jun 24, 2016"
AllMusic,75,"Virgins is dark and brilliant and haunting as it raises the hairs on the back of your neck, while Love Streams washes over you--or sometimes floats by off in the horizon--due to its subtlety and complex, deliberate construction.","Jun 24, 2016"

Pitchfork,70,"Simply enough, Love Streams is a discomforting listen, and the addition of voices to Hecker's repertoire adds an additional tool of disorientation to his web of repurposed crackles and spurts, not the warmth one might expect.","Jun 24, 2016"
Q Magazine,70,"The atmosphere of this music is lighter and less haunted than some of Mr. Heckers past work; some parts of the new album, like Music of the Air, can be thrilling in its evocation of a seamless connection between the physical and the synthetic. It also, sometimes, seems more impersonal, as if the ideas have the edge over their physical manifestation.","Jun 24, 2016"
The Independent (UK),70,"Love Streams manages to break through the vaulted cathedral ceilings and peer above the clouds, largely eschewing the degraded, gothic textures Hecker has become so fond of in favor of more vivid, almost celestial palettes.","Jun 24, 2016"
Rolling Stone,70,"There are moments when the structure of this album fails to centre itself, and it is easy to get lost in the finer details of the arrangements. ...

The Observer (UK),80,"[III's] not all that different from their great 2013 album, II, but III experiments more, sacrificing none of its attractiveness while venturing into skittish micro-trap (lead single 'Reminder'), exotic ethno-techno ('Animal Trails'), and something akin to Adele singing William S. Burroughs lyrics over classic glitch ('Eating Hooks').","Jun 24, 2016"
Under The Radar,80,"Their latest offering confirms the act have found footing with their sound, as III revels in minimal electro glitch while an orchestral current weaves beautifully throughout, Ring's vocals lending soulful, poignant reflection not often found in contemporary electronic music.","Jun 24, 2016"
DIY Magazine,80,"It makes for an often remarkable synthesis of the visceral and ethereal. The nine streamlined, artfully structured songs are patient and less dense, frequently relying on the separation between beats for power.","Jun 24, 2016"

Sputnikmusic,71,"Though it's Moderat's strongest record, III isn't quite all killer. The very Field-like 'Finder' bounces its vocal loop into the pocket, but it doesn't show off the songcraft found on songs like 'Reminder,' which might have sprung from a solo album by Thom Yorke.","Jun 24, 2016"
PopMatters,70,"Unrestrained emotion is ultimately III's defining attribute, and that richness can be too much to bear.","Jun 24, 2016"
AllMusic,70,"What this album lacks in overall improvement it makes up for with excellent performances and some of the groups best work thus far.","Jun 24, 2016"

Mojo,65,"Moderat's pop ambitions are clear. And mostly fulfilled. [No. 130, p.59]","Jun 24, 2016"
Record Collector,60,"III has a highly melodic crossover feel that is somewhat different to many of the players other, grittier projects, although the beats remain a little itchy.

Pitchfork,80,"PSB B-sides are larks and experiments of the highest order, so while Super scores as high as the crossover-ish Electric, it's built more for the fan who puts 'Paninaro' at the top of their list, well ahead of 'West End Girls.'","Jun 24, 2016"
Mixmag,80,"The thing is absolutely laced with wall-to-wall bangers.","Jun 24, 2016"
Resident Advisor,80,"Super is confirmation of their position at the head of the pop pantheon with an album brimming with excitement and fizzing with energy.","Jun 24, 2016"
PopMatters,80,"Super, as you will have gathered, is both old and new. It is old in the sense that all the Pet Shop Boys calling cards are here--the vocal clarity, the production precision, the wry observations on daytime ordinariness and night time escapism. Yet the nostalgia trip is a good move, with Price giving their beats a firmer kick.","Jun 24, 2016"
Mixmag,80,"What drives Super, though, is the duos overarching vision, which helps the album flow together like a night at a club: one that Pet Shop Boys exist inside and above, simultaneously.","Jun 24, 2016"
AllMusic,80,"On its own terms, Super succeeds brilliantly. Price, who has also done great work for Madonna and New Order, is adept at highlighting the core values of pop veterans while adding a contemporary edge. Every track sounds punchy, urgent and laser bright.","Jun 24, 2016"

AllMusic,70,"Super is a grower--a brave rejection of pipe and slippers, embracing the mythical dance floor with admirably vacuous experimentation, even if it mines the mid-nineties, when dance music grew least interesting.","Jun 24, 2016"

AllMusic,70,"Super's best songs cleverly subvert the expectations set up by the joyous music.","Jun 24, 2016"
The Quietus,69,"Super elaborates and intensifies Electrics approach: Louder, brighter, more. It doesnt have the sustained arc of that album, but Price specializes in renovating house and disco, modernizing with care, and his small details still beguile.","Jun 24, 2016"
Clash Music,60,"At times, though, the bleepy, burbling fun gets too wacky and cheesy for even PSBs long-standing irony to uphold.","Jun 24, 2016"
The Independent (UK),60,"The album is full of the group's signature dreamy arpeggios, massive drum rolls, epic builds and breaks--expertly produced with Stuart Price. But it's the push and pull between the sociopolitical reality and urge to escape into nightlife, where dressing up, social cliques and the pounding beat of pop music can feel life-saving, that fuels the drama.","Jun 24, 2016"
Mixmag,60,"Supers first half euphorically lives up to the title, tossing out gem after gem, making you nostalgic for the days where erudition in pop wasnt so rare.... The second half loses momentum slightly.","Jun 24, 2016"
Q Magazine,60,"All through this listenable, though frankly inconsequential album, PSB are stuck on a sound: it's that booming release of early '90s dance, filtered through a bit of early-noughties terpsichorean quiet-loud sonic sexiness. [May 2016, p.86]","Jun 24, 2016"
Uncut,58,"While Super is not indicative of the next big thing, and a few of the more club-oriented numbers sound more like remixes than actual songs, its an enjoyable way of catching up with the Pet Shop Boys while being served something fresh.","Jun 24, 2016"
Under The Radar,55,"All in all, it makes for a record whose potential to be exceptional is all-too frustrating.","Jun 24, 2016"

Tiny Mix Tapes,80,"Minor setbacks aside, its another beautiful, consumable collection of music from Bibio that no other artist could make sound so inherently theirs, and one that leaves Wilkinson's future musical trajectory as wide open as its ever been.","Jun 24, 2016"
XLR8r,80,"Altogether, as lovely as its title suggests. [May 2016, p.104]","Jun 24, 2016"
PopMatters,80,"Against all odds, A Mineral Love is simultaneously Bibios most accessible effort, his most daring set of songs to date, and, yes, his masterpiece.","Jun 24, 2016"
The Wire,70,"While nostalgia has always been a theme in Bibio's music, it reaches a peak in A Mineral Love, switching between shiny '80s production and the aforementioned decade's more laid-back grooves. It doesn't feel as if Wilkinson has found which of these sounds he prefers yet, meaning that this record never has the consistency to be considered a great rather than good album.","Jun 24, 2016"
Mojo,68,"A Mineral Love bursts with cheerful, candy-colored falsetto funk, not unlike Ambivalence, while leaving out the crunch and glitch, letting the instruments breathe.","Jun 24, 2016"
Spin,67,"A Mineral Love fails when Bibio overcrowds the music or gives over the reins. For those moments when he stands confidently at the helm, however, the record becomes his best in years.","Jun 24, 2016"
AllMusic,60,"Despite the vast flavours Bibio is presenting throughout this record, so much of the quality production is slighted by tracing the same predictable frequencies and manoeuvres as so many servile songwriters leagues below have made prospering careers out of.","Jun 24, 2016"

Rolling Stone,75,"The Follower feels more progressive and experimental than anything that's gone before it.","Jun 24, 2016"
Spin,70,"Willner continues to move into more exploratory territory, though in taking his music to a denser, more obtuse place, the divine simplicity thats defined his entire body of work suffers.","Jun 24, 2016"
New Musical Express (NME),70,"As ever, indisposed listeners with little patience will hear Willner's tracks as distended and routine. Those who can't get enough of the stuff have another reliably durable set of techno that draws from dream pop, dub, and Krautrock. It has the potential to stupefy, if in very familiar fashion.","Jun 24, 2016"

The Observer (UK),60,"The Follower is a decent enough record, and is worthy of your time, but lacks that special something that sets The Field apart in the techno world.","Jun 24, 2016"

Q Magazine,80,"Despite references to hard drugs and depression, Boeckners songwriting betrays an unconventional joyfulness, marked more by the relief between emotional peaks and valleys than by its strict verse-chorus-verse structures. In fact, in my opinion, this is the first project of his that measures favorably against the solo work of his more cultishly-beloved bandmate and rival.","Jun 24, 2016"
DIY Magazine,80,"Packed with tight hooks, this record adds plenty of new songs to Operators' repertoire that are sure to keep the crowds dancing late into the night.","Jun 24, 2016"
AllMusic,75,"Boeckner's melodies are precise and the choruses show moments of bright clarity cutting through the foggy verses: not unlike fleeing a bleak reality to find asylum in a dream. He hasn't sounded this committed and angry since leading Atlas Strategic a decade and a half ago.","Jun 24, 2016"
No Ripcord,75,"Unsurprisingly, Blue Wave, the bands first proper LP, sounds both old and new at once.","Jun 24, 2016"
The Quietus,62,"Blue Wave is not about moving forward, but using the past works of artists to create something fun and mildly pleasurable.","Jun 24, 2016"
Boston Globe,60,"Blue Wave fails to clarify what kind of band Operators truly is. Are they post-punk rabble-rousers? A modern pop band hiding behind retro synths? A gritty indie rock trio? Of course, they're all of the above, with Boeckner happily shape-shifting in between.","Jun 24, 2016"

Tiny Mix Tapes,80,"Silicon Tare is an exciting warm-up for the epic conclusion to the Com Truise story.","Jun 24, 2016"
Slant Magazine,70,"Its a very strong release, energetic and intense, and promises a high-octane finale.","Jun 24, 2016"
Drowned In Sound,60,"Silicon Tare sounds like 2010, which could be a good thing, depending on how you look at it.","Jun 24, 2016"
Consequence of Sound,60,"Silicon Tare is a Com Truise EP for Com Truise fans, and as nice as it may be to add five more perfectly calibrated tracks to the collection, it seems like an empty gesture at the same time.","Jun 24, 2016"
Pitchfork,60,"One hopes that once this space opera is complete Haley will allow himself to broaden his horizons a bit more. In the meantime, Silicon Tare is worth a listen.","Jun 24, 2016"
Record Collector,59,"The five tracks here differ from their predecessors only by degrees, so if you liked the previous records there's little here to find too upsetting, but as an EP it feels like a stopgap ahead of the next Com Truise album.","Jun 24, 2016"

The Wire,80,"A series of folds, jump cuts and swarms, it's disorienting yet utterly gorgeous. [Jun 2016, p.79]","Jun 22, 2016"
Dusted Magazine,80,"A fascinating open-ended audio experiment, Felder is an unpredictable album that pushes the limits of technology and composition.","Jun 22, 2016"
Mixmag,80,"On Felder, St. Werner is coming closer to melding his two personalities, allowing his Type A to influence his Type B.","Jun 22, 2016"
Clash Music,70,"Its resistance to structure creates in the listener a heightened awareness of each individual sound, and the resulting friction or harmony when pressed against another.","Jun 22, 2016"
Resident Advisor,70,"Whether connected of standing on its own, Felder is a challenging experiment and yet an endlessly rewarding, even comforting, listen.","Jun 22, 2016"
Uncut,60,"An engrossing work in which the organic and electronic intermingle to create complex layers of sound; Felder invites you to explore its singular terrain.","Jun 22, 2016"
The Skinny,60,"Though not for every taste, Felder has enough going on to be more than just aural wallpaper.","Jun 22, 2016"

Record Collector,82,"On EARS, Smith emerges as a novel, naturalistic and, yes, pop-savvy voice wielding an instrument known for esoteric experimentalism.","Jun 17, 2016"
AllMusic,80,"Smith creates wide-eyed compositions with textures that cascade over one another, capturing the vast celestial wonder of synthesized sound.","Jun 17, 2016"

musicOMH.com,80,"Focused without sounding rigid or confined, Ears is imaginative and alive.","Jun 17, 2016"
Exclaim,80,"For a technically sophisticated record that doesnt have a great deal of dynamic range, EARS has a surprisingly strong emotional tug.","Jun 17, 2016"
The 405,80,"In timbre and voice alike, the new LP is startlingly, richly fulsome, commingling the mysticism of Smithsonian Folkways LPs, IDMs furrowed futurism, and the free-fall questing of Laurie Spiegels 1980 landmark, The Expanding Universe.","Jun 17, 2016"
Clash Music,70,"The music feels less homogeneous, perhaps slightly more erratic, than on Euclid, but still with the overall feeling of beauty and future-looking exploration.","Jun 17, 2016"

The Quietus,78,"As a set of tracks for DJs to pick from, Rojus offers plenty of potential. As a front-to-back listening experience, it's almost paradise--but not quite the album that it wants to be.","Jun 10, 2016"
The Guardian,68,"Where his best music was like reading pages from a diary, Rojus can feel like a passionate retelling of memories that were never his.","Jun 10, 2016"

Mojo,91,"Potential not only makes a shockingly strong case for the top tier of contemporary sample-indebted achievements (alongside pillars including Burials Rival Dealer EP and Jamie xxs In Colour), but does so while insisting that the universe, much like ourselves, will never be explored in its entirety.","Jun 10, 2016"
Uncut,83,"The Ranges new album Potential overflows with humanity, and that fact is what elevates it from just a quality electronic record to a universally important piece of work.","Jun 10, 2016"
Pitchfork,80,"Potential is as great an album as it is a story, and the songs allow you to sink into them while simultaneously offering a chance to think about ones dreams and actually putting in the effort to chase them.","Jun 10, 2016"
Tiny Mix Tapes,80,"Literally, Potential comes from a place of empathy. So its not surprising that its best when it isolates all the feelings loaded into a single word or phrase.","Jun 10, 2016"
Exclaim,80,"Potential is a ripe showcase of Hinton's gift for alchemising base source material from unknowns such as London's MC SdotStar and Jamaica's Naturaliss into truly transformative dance pop. [May 2016, p.90]","Jun 10, 2016"
musicOMH.com,80,"That sense of newfound freedom and exaltation surges through Potential, a rich matrix of the Ranges knack for digging up strangers stories and assimilating breakbeat, grime, U.K. garage, and late 90s R&B.","Jun 10, 2016"
AllMusic,80,"Whether you're aware of the conceptual backstory behind Potential or come into the project blind, Hinton makes the album just as conceptually moody as it is conceptually aural.","Jun 10, 2016"
PopMatters,80,"While Hinton's selections vary wildly in style, the production is both fluid and empathic. [May 2016, p.114]","Jun 10, 2016"
XLR8r,80,"Its a creative, deeply introspective record that makes up for in depth what it doesnt quite reach in soaring heights.","Jun 10, 2016"
Q Magazine,80,"Hinton has an ability, not unlike the Books when they first hit the scene 14 years ago, of making shopworn techniques in sound manipulations seem strangely fresh, and Potential is the kind of music that makes you think about what your own part in a seemingly passive musical transaction of music might mean.","Jun 10, 2016"
Uncut,80,"Its narrative arc and Hintons own emotional investment into the project elevates Potential over some of the more high profile electronic releases of the past few years.","Jun 10, 2016"
The Quietus,74,"Potential is largely a wonderful collection of uplifting and humbling electronic pop.","Jun 10, 2016"
Pitchfork,70,"Potential is an intriguing glimpse at the human identities hiding behind computer screens, and how emotions are expressed through the filter of social media.","Jun 10, 2016"
Resident Advisor,70,"Plucking samples from wannabe grime MCs and unknown divas and weaving these into his uplifting electronica proves surprisingly moving. [May 2016, p.79]","Jun 10, 2016"
The Wire,60,"The title is optimistic: few of these vocalists display obvious potential, and their presence amid Hintons finely calibrated beats can be jarring. The clockwork production accentuates their awkwardness.... It helps that Hintons regard for these wannabe superstars seems genuine.","Jun 10, 2016"

Mojo,80,"Blending bossa with trip-hop and samba with vintage synths, she creates an entirely contemporary blend. [Jul 2016, p.91]","Jun 10, 2016"
Tiny Mix Tapes,80,"It is the most artfully rendered and sophisticated recording in her catalog, the work of a mature artist in full command of a sonic language. It's also a hell of a lot of fun to listen and dance to.","Jun 10, 2016"
Resident Advisor,80,"The crooned, English-language Chico Buarque Song is an unashamed stab at the global pop market and less original, but this is still an impressive comeback.","Jun 10, 2016"
Dusted Magazine,80,"[A] stylistically varied, intricately detailed, slyly coherent fourth album.","Jun 10, 2016"

Mixmag,91,"These tracks dont feel futuristic, but they shine with a blinding light, capping one of the most impressive arcs of any album so far this year.","Jun 10, 2016"
The Wire,90,"Its both pretty much anything you could ask for as a long-term fan and the kind of late-period album that is actually worth spreading beyond the faithful.","Jun 10, 2016"
AllMusic,85,"Sometimes you have to look back to move forward, and by doing that, Underworld have made their best album in almost twenty years.","Jun 10, 2016"

The Line of Best Fit,81,"Underworlds never had trouble getting listeners to their feet. This gorgeously love-drunk finale makes Barbara a record that can bring them to their knees.","Jun 10, 2016"
PopMatters,80,"From the thumping, industrial charge of I Exhale to the sublimely hypnotic techno of Low Burn, Underworld are in full form, giving meaning and substance to every single minute with hardly a wasted moment.","Jun 10, 2016"
The Quietus,80,"An album on which Underworld reestablish themselves as supreme dance music architects.","Jun 10, 2016"
Pitchfork,80,"The forceful pace and commanding lyric-mangling that originally brought them to the publics attention are still very much in place.","Jun 10, 2016"
Consequence of Sound,80,"There are several elements from their entire career fused with new ones, as well as a newfound accessibility that also signals a creativity boost. It's great to see Underworld this vital once again, indeed facing a shining future.","Jun 10, 2016"
Under The Radar,80,"Where Barking was all about the kinetic energy of the feet and arms, Barbara joins the soul and the head, its rhythms enhancing rather than driving the experience.","Jun 10, 2016"

Magnet,80,"Barbara Barbara, We Face a Shining Future is never weighed down by its makers history.","Jun 10, 2016"
PopMatters,80,"Barbara, the duo's first album of original material together in five years, often stacks up with their best work and suggests that the ideas they pioneered in the '90s aren't just back en vogue--they've held up amid decades of fast-moving techno.","Jun 10, 2016"
AllMusic,80,"Hyde and Smith prove they still have the Midas touch.","Jun 10, 2016"

PopMatters,75,"Those looking to understand the evolution of electronica across the pond will find that Barbara Barbara, we face a shining future will welcome them in nearly as much as Underworlds debut LP.","Jun 10, 2016"
AllMusic,75,"Weighing in at just seven songs, album number eight is a far meatier experience than it seems.","Jun 10, 2016"
Pitchfork,70,"Underworld refuse to heed their own advice, and the subtle juxtaposition of light and dark elevate Barbara from a decent listen to an enthralling one.","Jun 10, 2016"
Magnet,70,"Underworld have forsworn the well-trodden path of replication and opted instead for another path. Gone are the tub-thumpers of yore in favour of understated, yet nevertheless, euphoric electronica bursting with hope.","Jun 10, 2016"
Uncut,70,"Barbara Barbara... makes explicit the band's influence, as well as their core strengths. [Apr 2016, p.81]","Jun 10, 2016"
The Line of Best Fit,60,"Its purpose is to cement Underworld as elder statesmen of minor-arena-filling, rather than floor-filling, amorphously electronic music. Its not hip, but its not square either.","Jun 10, 2016"
AllMusic,60,"That could stand as a motto for the album: this is music seeking to let in the light.","Jun 10, 2016"
Rock Sound,60,"The album, which at just seven tracks long (and none of them 15-minute monsters on the order of Juanita) feels almost like a two-fisted EP.","Jun 10, 2016"
Kerrang!,60,"Barbara... is less massive comeback than slight return.","Jun 10, 2016"

Pretty Much Amazing,60,"Toxic synths and an undeniable sense of occasion pervade, the record sounds appropriately big and it just about steers clear of unwanted pomposity.","Jun 10, 2016"
AllMusic,60,"There's a point during Transuranic Heavy Elements where the bludgeoning beats pause and something (Guitars? You? The earth?) begins to howl, and you think: This is probably not for everyone.","Jun 10, 2016"

NOW Magazine,90,"Its reminiscent of that doyenne of experimental electronica, Laurie Anderson--and thats a heck of a compliment.","Jun 10, 2016"
The New York Times,80,"Unlike your average grime productions, these tracks are rarely propulsive or tailored for the dancefloor, but rather shift and shake convulsively under the weight of stark, metronomic beats, swathes of sub-bass and icy synth swirls. Listen carefully, and there is a certain melodicism nestled in the heart of this album, but its tone is despairing and subdued, glimmers of light in a dark and uncaring world.","Jun 10, 2016"
Magnet,80,"Its loose theme is authority: on Curfew and Battery, beats hit like police baton rounds, sirens wail and every chord feels significant. [May 2016, p.91]","Jun 10, 2016"
Uncut,80,"All discussion of technique aside though, there can be no doubt that with Brute, Al Qadiri has invoked her own personal brand of protest in a world in which discussion over that right has become ever more charged.","Jun 10, 2016"
musicOMH.com,80,"Though the sonic palette, beautiful and immersive, warm like a hot mug in the frost, the dubstep-derived hints of double-time, perpetually held in reserve, create  the ominous feeling of an attack dog straining at the leash. [Apr 2016, p.69]","Jun 10, 2016"
Boston Globe,80,"Her conceptual sounds dont offer blatant, fist pumping anthems for movements like Occupy and Black Lives Matter, instead they seem to capture the still, quiet tension that echoes around that space between the battle lines and point to the psychological fear on both sides.","Jun 10, 2016"
Exclaim,75,"Cleverly sampling the incapacitating Long Range Acoustic Device (LRAD), the Kuwaiti-born producer offers a sonic account of the power utilized to deter political uprisings. Al Qadiri, though, uses the fragility of her signature minor chord progressions to rebut that aggression.","Jun 10, 2016"
The Line of Best Fit,73,"Overall Brute is a frustrating mish-mosh of middling and artful. When its working, there is a certain panache in the high-powered, informationally dense musical speedballs she creates.","Jun 10, 2016"
Pitchfork,70,"In essence, Brute is dark ambient grime, with Al Qadiri's stamping drums and probing bass frequencies heard less frequently than her synthesized choirs and horns. At its most vivid, it evokes the feeling of anticipating a shove or a bean bag round.","Jun 10, 2016"
Sputnikmusic,70,"There are moments of serene beauty, like 'Oubliette' and the seductive gondola romance of 'Fragmentation,' but the album's action scenes feel glossy and detached, picturesque rather than visceral. [Mar 2016, p.42]","Jun 10, 2016"
Under The Radar,70,"Despite the forcefulness of its concept, Brute thus often feels less like music of protest than music of exhaustion, confusion, and diffuse rage. This can make for an oppressive and tiring listen, but at best its effect is unsettling, and suggestive of traumatised detachment--a familiar enough reaction to the barrage of grim reports that make up the daily online news churn.","Jun 10, 2016"
The 405,60,"Rarely makes for easy listening.... though the album's second half is notably more harmonious. [May 2016, p.104]","Jun 10, 2016"
The Guardian,60,"Her signature hollowed-out minimalism nicely suits the subject matter, sometimes rising in urgency before falling into a deceptive calm.","Jun 10, 2016"
Slant Magazine,50,"Brute's most interesting flourishes are all surface-level. Take them away and you're left with Al Qadiri reusing the same musical ideas.","Jun 10, 2016"
Spin,40,"Her more grime-like productions bite with milk teeth, and melodies forget the errands they were sent on. Do her anaemic laments symbolise a generation being drained of its political lifeblood? Perhaps, but they arent enjoyable to listen to.","Jun 10, 2016"

PopMatters,70,"[A] solid, surprising set.","Jun  3, 2016"

Rolling Stone,20,"A deliriously infantile playhouse of sound. [May 2016, p.51]","Jun  3, 2016"
DIY Magazine,20,"The other 14 contributions barely stand apart from one another, a rushed bile of the same sounds being used over and over again by unidentifiable producers, with only Bonobo delivering a track whose atmosphere extends beyond that of gimmicky tie-in music territory.","Jun  3, 2016"

Drowned In Sound,100,"Its confidently compressed, and where this kind of urban dance music can serve as a vehicle for ego, Rodrigues' deft arrangements and choice guests speak for him--and speak volumes.","May 27, 2016"
Mojo,90,"If there's one thing that Aa demonstrates in spades, it's growth. The record not only shows a wide array of styles, but lays a solid foundation for Baauer to build on in the future.","May 27, 2016"
Consequence of Sound,80,"Aa, as unfortunately quick as it is, shows a phenomenal young producer at the top of his game, and its a joy to experience.","May 27, 2016"
Drowned In Sound,80,"Nothing bores and the album moves through its track list with a purposeful flow, and while electro-trap fiends and 'Harlem Shake' lovers may be thrown by all the artful noise, Aa still rocks the house, as Baauer evolves from meme generator to master craftsman.","May 27, 2016"
Exclaim,75,"For what Aa ultimately assumes itself to be--a glorified promo tape of talents--the result is quite enjoyable.","May 27, 2016"

Pitchfork,66,"Aa isn't a disappointment, but clocking in at 34 minutes with a handful of tracks that feel unfinished, it's not exactly a home run either.","May 27, 2016"
Record Collector,60,"The trap style that made his name is falling out of fashion, and his stabs at en vogue sounds like trop house (Body) and UK garage (Way from Me) are a little tepid. He also clears out space for on-their-game vocal guests including MIA and Pusha T--but not quite enough, resulting in some diverting but ultimately earthbound rap tracks.","May 27, 2016"
Tiny Mix Tapes,60,"So many genres collide on Aa it can feel like being trapped in a virtual karaoke machine. [Apr 2016, p.102]","May 27, 2016"

The Observer (UK),80,"It all makes for a heartfelt, satisfying whole that reaffirms Lust for Youth as one of the few bands reinterpreting the '80s that can rival and surpass its influences as well as its contemporaries.","May 27, 2016"
AllMusic,80,"Even with the cop-out dream pop closer of In Return tarnishing what could be a great record, Lust for Youths Compassion treats its influences with the care that realizes the importance of going beyond such a sound rather than completely imitating it.","May 27, 2016"
The Guardian,80,"Packing too much tunefulness and pop sensibility to ever feel crushingly miserable, Compassion is nevertheless ripe for wallowing in.","May 27, 2016"
Clash Music,80,"Compassion is such an easy listen. The melodies are so cheerful, so simple and memorable, they require absolutely no effort to enjoy.","May 27, 2016"
The Skinny,75,"Compassion is Lust For Youth's most compact album, with only 8 tracks, and benefits from its trim nature.","May 27, 2016"
Uncut,75,"As a whole, Compassion is very impressive. Its a largely fat-free collection of club-ready Danish synth-pop.","May 27, 2016"
Mojo,70,"The darkness is more fully embraced on Easy Window, which smoulders elegantly and possesses a distinct undertow full of sorrow and a sense of detachment. When its done this well, its hard not to get swept up in it, but there are moments when it doesnt quite come off.","May 27, 2016"
Q Magazine,67,"For a prolific set of musicians, Compassion feels like the work of a group taking time to flesh out their ideas. With this headier approach comes a loss of some of the engaging, energetic moments of International, but also a renewed confidence.","May 27, 2016"
Resident Advisor,62,"Many of the songs here sound not just derivative but generic. Compassion still feels like the album that Lust For Youth have been working toward this whole time--it just turns out that the journey may have been more rewarding than the destination.","May 27, 2016"
Pretty Much Amazing,60,"Compassion is the trios second album, and its eight songs straddle the line between the past and the present, between melancholy gloom and euphoric dance music.","May 27, 2016"
The A.V. Club,60,"Here honing the bright and distinctively Nordic sound that enlivened 2014's International, they even flirt with becoming a pop group, albeit one wearing its '80s fixation with pride. [Jun 2016, p.113]","May 27, 2016"
Magnet,60,"With room for refinement this isnt LFYs crowning glory by any stretch, but its a purposeful record that shows a trio holding on to the makings of something quite special.","May 27, 2016"
Slant Magazine,60,"That lack of restraint, of wanting to offer moments of merriment through straightforward movements, is not as revealing as it is expected, though Compassion is at its most gripping when it decides to go against the grain.","May 27, 2016"
The New York Times,60,"Compassions best moments share this kineticism: the chirpy cowbell entry in Sudden Ambition; Tokyos driving bass. When the pace slows however, the groups very affected 80s-evoking style becomes a bit overbearing, so committed to its trendy celestial shtick that it runs the risk of rebounding past retro-chic back into tacky territory again.","May 27, 2016"
Spin,50,"While the second half of the album almost makes up for its flaws, it doesn't quite manage to make Compassion a memorable whole.","May 27, 2016"

The Wire,90,"The debut is one of my picks for the year so far, a dance-hall record that grows on your and becomes more like a trusted friend who whispers wisdom from another universe.","May 27, 2016"
DIY Magazine,80,"Full Circle might not break any new ground, but with their simple yet thought-provoking approach to songwriting, HLOS have crafted one of the best debut albums in 2016 thus far.","May 27, 2016"
Clash Music,80,"What began with hope and reassurance ends with darkness and uncertainty. However, despite the loss of faith and the world crashing down, the band declares 'here I'm alive' and the cycle begins anew.","May 27, 2016"
Q Magazine,80,"This is an album that pulls you up out of gloom and into exultation, and if its manipulative that way, so be it.  As Watts says, we would like to be like that, and Full Circle makes it feel, at least for a little while, like we are.","May 27, 2016"
AllMusic,77,"By wearing their influences on their sleeve while never slipping into gimmickry, HLOS are able to pull off an impressive trick, a debut record that both cements them in a genre and leaves then room to grow.","May 27, 2016"
Exclaim,70,"Full Circle is a promising start for a trio of artists who already possess a clear vision of the type of music they want to create. The chances are they will only improve with time to grow their songcraft and ideas further.","May 27, 2016"
Boston Globe,70,"Full Circle is electronic pop dance music of its own ilk, at once welcomingly familiar and completely unique, and best played after the bar, after the subway ride home. It is living room swaying music at its absolute best.","May 27, 2016"
The Skinny,67,"For these 11 tracks, trip-hops habit for overcooked sad bastard balladry is traded for such succinct fluidity in songwriting that the moments where the album betrays its debut description are few and far between.","May 27, 2016"
Under The Radar,65,"What it is, is a nice collection of dark trip-hop pop songs influenced by some great names but without forcing you to remember the name of HLOS. A little more substance over style will lead HLOS to bigger and better things.","May 27, 2016"
Pitchfork,60,"The sound HLOS have refined is the perfect foil for truly spectacular things to happen, but with the exception of the albums centerpiece, Oracle, Full Circle consistently gives the impression that the tools arent being used as efficiently as they could be.","May 27, 2016"
Resident Advisor,60,"There arent any outright failures on Full Circle--Bernardout and her bandmates Dom Goldsmith and Arthur Delaney are too talented to turn out a subpar project--but there are moments that simply lack staying power.","May 27, 2016"
PopMatters,60,"HLOS are clearly intent on shunning tradition. With that in mind, this is a promising start.","May 27, 2016"

musicOMH.com,78,"The Last Panthers goes further, illustrating a picture of its own.","May 27, 2016"
Boston Globe,75,"There are glorious moments of reflection to be found throughout The Last Panthers too. Circuitous, sweeping pad interludes that, more often than not, come in the form of unusual and unsettling chord progressions to jolt the beauty that's frequently on offer.","May 27, 2016"
The Guardian,71,"What is most impressive about The Last Panthers is the way in which Clark has taken all of this incidental music and shaped it into a flowing 48-minute suite that conjures almost as much of an imagined visual story as The Last Panthers show itself.","May 27, 2016"
Q Magazine,70,"The Last Panthers will probably not either amaze or horrify long-time fans, but it does prove that Clark is quite capable of working outside of his comfort zone.","May 27, 2016"

PopMatters,80,"In the now vastly-populated electronic marketplace, this is an album well worth investigating as an example of passionate scientists adding the musics past immortal strategies to the planets ever-buzzing soundtrack to take it proudly into the future, rather than contenting themselves with replicating hoary old blueprints.","May 27, 2016"
Under The Radar,80,"Advancement ends up being an appropriate title, as this album largely dispenses with the cheesy elements that marred previous Solar Bears recordings, resulting in their most accomplished and enjoyable release to date.","May 27, 2016"
Pitchfork,70,"The good easily outweighs the bad on Advancement, and at its best, it's excellent. The pair have a knack for dynamism that keeps things interesting, and their production style has a compelling crunchiness to it that manages to sound modern without laying on the sheen.","May 27, 2016"
Consequence of Sound,64,"This LP has the duo's best music; each track offers something to marvel at. But put them all together and it's like watching the world end 11 times in a row: what at first seems fearsome eventually turns mundane.","May 27, 2016"
Clash Music,60,"There is nothing particularly ground breaking or original about Solar Bears, and their music can feel a little samey at times. Despite these shortcomings, Advancement is still a thoroughly enjoyable, lushly textured record that rarely fails to absorb.","May 27, 2016"

Mojo,80,"Its hard to single out a standalone track from this impressive debut and this, in itself, is testament to the LP on the whole.","May 20, 2016"
musicOMH.com,80,"Its a delicate, naked offering that flits between mournful vocals, processed backward synths and serrated edges of what sounds like guitar distortion.","May 20, 2016"
Dusted Magazine,80,"Significantly more experimental than Colleran's previous work, Luneworks also feels much more personal, and it continues to establish MMOTHS as a unique voice in the indie electronic scene.","May 20, 2016"

AllMusic,70,"he album seems to come closer to the lineage of synthesizer innovators like Raymond Scott rather than most techno or ambient artists, even if there's a relaxed, meditative feel to a lot of these pieces, and it showcase's Bourne's skill for exploring the vast capabilities of his instrument.","May 20, 2016"

Uncut,70,"Its certainly not the most exciting piece of music to come out of Submotions instruments--that would certainly still go to their debut LP, Finest Hour--but its a pleasant one nonetheless, one which radiates positivity and hope, albeit in a slightly different manner than they may have done it in the past.","May 19, 2016"

PopMatters,80,"The weakest tracks--the hackneyed anthem Love Is Blind, the dreary Hurt Me--are the most radio-friendly and interrupt the album's flow. But that's not a major drawback. In fact, for many new artists, either track would be a high-water mark.","May 13, 2016"
Record Collector,80,"At 47 minutes, Long Way Home may seem lengthy for a debut, but it feels cohesive without boxing Lpsley into a limited sound.","May 13, 2016"
Blurt Magazine,80,"Long Way Home is a vindication of all that time spent slowly learning her craft and doing almost everything herself. As a result, she has finally delivered what all those early tracks promised; a bedroom record conceived in the club that drags confessional pop music further into the future.","May 13, 2016"
Resident Advisor,80,"On Long Way Home, she delivers these in spades.","May 13, 2016"
Boston Globe,80,"The album comes to life with the radio-friendly, dancefloor-ready banger Operator (He Doesn't Call Me), but only one track, Love Is Blind, errs on the side of the saccharine and straightforward. [Apr 2016, p.109]","May 13, 2016"
Clash Music,80,"Lpsley has expressed a fondness for writing sad songs, and while there's a pervasive melancholy to Long Way Home, it remains both accessible and sonically explorative throughout.","May 13, 2016"

Uncut,75,"Lpsleys technical abilities are not to be questioned; her stamp is all over this albums production, and her sonic impulses rarely stray far from on point. But when her heart starts to catch up with her head, as it does intermittently on Long Way Home, whoo boy: Watch out.","May 13, 2016"
AllMusic,70,"For now, shes created an unimpeachably well-crafted debut--something to gaze at, even if it is just a sequence of gazes itself.","May 13, 2016"

Spin,70,"Its these minimal moments of Long Way Home that work best.","May 13, 2016"
PopMatters,70,"If not a break-up album, a dreading-breaking-up album whose pace, palette, minor chords, and Lpsley's disquieted vocal performances all collaborate for a debut that's impressively locked into a distinct head space.","May 13, 2016"
Mojo,66,"The unusual dependence on space in the arrangements can make the interiors of Lpsleys songs seem uncannily empty, glassy structures with their insides removed so all thats left is angled crystal.... But in other instances her voice dissolves into an overabundance of negative space, and listening to the less-inspired sections of Long Way Home can feel like trying to remember something boring that happened to you once.","May 13, 2016"
AllMusic,60,"Here are 12 songs about emotional hurt and partial recovery; some cliche-ridden (yes, one song here is really called Love Is Blind), others classy and nagging.","May 13, 2016"
Pitchfork,60,"Lpsleys own attempts at Adele-sized mainstream hits are a bit too obvious--see Operator (He Doesnt Call Me), bred in a Petri dish with Mark Ronson, Amy Winehouse and some cowbells. Better are the moments when it gets a bit brooding.","May 13, 2016"

Consequence of Sound,80,"Gorgeously sepulchral pieces such as Beste Freunde and Glasterlenspiel are perfectly suited to the church where they were recorded as longer improvisations to be edited down, suspending time as they hang in hauntingly contemplative reverie, which is still breaking boundaries.

Pretty Much Amazing,80,"The musics depth, and it is deeper than any other Q/C/Kluster album, encompasses myth and poetry while eschewing assumption and pretense. It walks a fine line between accessibility and the intrigue of novelty while never allowing timbre self-satisfying supremacy.","May 13, 2016"
PopMatters,80,"Unlike the cohesiveness of earlier releases, Echtzeit has the feel of a compendium of sketches playing upon inherent strengths within Roedelius's considerable back catalogue. However, what it lacks in experiential probing is made up for by the simple fact of Echtzeit being a nice place to dwell and linger.","May 13, 2016"
Drowned In Sound,80,"No matter how much Krautrock youve been exposed to over the decades, Qluster can still use familiar terrain to create quite an impact. You dont have to rip up the playbook over and over again in order to conjure something that really hits the mark.","May 13, 2016"

AllMusic,70,"As it is, listeners will probably hear Prince Rama with one eyebrow raised, which is a shame. Some art is best appreciated when one isnt preoccupied with being smarter than the artist.","May 13, 2016"
Uncut,60,"X-Treme Now is an intriguing, often entertaining bit of art from a duo that seem locked into a long-running lark that sometimes, perhaps accidentally or even incidentally, delivers the genuine article, sometimes makes do with platitudes and sidelong, distancing glances, but more often than not is a summery slab of fun.","May 13, 2016"

Pretty Much Amazing,83,"Varmints displays both extremely well crafted instrumentation, and an overwhelming creative freedom.","May 13, 2016"
PopMatters,80,"Varmints is a playfully delirious listen that constantly rewards with new ideas at every corner, one that sketches an idealized pop landscape without recognizing that it actually touches all of its requisite pleasure points.","May 13, 2016"

Dusted Magazine,80,"Her third album blends styles in a way that thrillingly recalls the kitchen-sink endeavors of the early new wave era.","May  6, 2016"
Mojo,80,"The whole album drips with Caribbean zest, the tropical bounce of 'Can't Get Enough Of Myself' and the pumping 'Rendezvous Girl' balanced by eccentric slowies such as the oddball power ballad 'Run The Races'. There's plenty more too, candied but with class and pop bite.","May  6, 2016"

AllMusic,60,"Some of the sparkle fades as the album goes on, with Run the Races and Outside the War especially ponderous, but this is another sure-footed set aimed as much at the head as at the hips.","May  6, 2016"
Rolling Stone,60,"Tolerance will vary for her reedy and slightly hectoring voice, and there are some thisll-do melodies with no logic or engine. But she still hints at being the omnivorous pop star we need.","May  6, 2016"
Consequence of Sound,60,"99 is an album buoyed by its sonic playfulness, but which fails to shake its playlist sensibility--entertaining, engaging but only occasionally leaving a lasting impression.","May  6, 2016"
The Wire,60,"More often than hitting a sweet spot in between, the songs here are overly busy (like Big Boss) or short on ideas (the by-the-numbers Before the Fire and the psych-rock Outside the War), and the album's title turns into an unfortunate allusion to a warehouse stocked to the brim with cheap toys, none built to last.","May  6, 2016"
Tiny Mix Tapes,58,"The fickle genres of 99 not only see Santigold challenging the rules of pop, but bettering herself. In writing for others, Santigold grows a backbone that defines her unapologetically bold sound, even if she doesnt push her lyrics as far as she does the music.","May  6, 2016"

Q Magazine,80,"This is Matmos doing what they do best: taking a strange idea for a wild digital ride until it turns into something completely magical.","Apr 29, 2016"
DIY Magazine,80,"The absence of track titles sometimes forces the listener to reach further into the album's alien sounds, but as Ultimate Care II hits the five-minute mark the novelty wears off and absorption into the composition's overall mood takes place, as Matmos do a terrific job of blending the album's noises (which ranges from water sloshing to lids slamming to knobs grinding) into a captivating whole.","Apr 29, 2016"

Pitchfork,55,"Its playful, dark, and produced well enough to settle the most pedantic of audiophiles. Its clear, however, that putting meaning to Matmos sounds here only rehashes tired ideas of neotribalism and criticisms of late-capitalism.","Apr 29, 2016"

The Line of Best Fit,80,"Daze is an astounding leap forward, harnessing an overwhelming amount of energy and transforming it into an arsenal of sonic warfare. The album also feels like it's the beginning of what could become a lengthy saga, with many additional battles to come.","Apr 29, 2016"
DIY Magazine,75,"Part of the success of Daze is how fully Brood Ma commits to his sonic palette without committing to a singular musical style.","Apr 29, 2016"

Resident Advisor,80,"Even with the album's epic length, it never feels meandering or indulgent, as Prins Thomas remains supremely focused throughout the entire journey, finding the duality between the different types of 'cosmic' music.","Apr 29, 2016"
The 405,70,"Principe del Norte is an album and collection of tracks to be heard but not necessarily listened to.","Apr 29, 2016"
Pitchfork,70,"It does function gorgeously as a lush, entrancing mood piece, one that might pleasantly percolate along in the background, but could just as easily hold you rapt in the detailed folds of its layered, continuously evolving subarctic suites. [No. 129, p.61]","Apr 29, 2016"

AllMusic,68,"Principe del Norte across as genial, charmingly rumpled, and totally unflappable.","Apr 29, 2016"
Uncut,60,"A subsequent stretch of pleasant but generic cosmic disco coasts on the listeners sangria-fuelled goodwill. But the urgency of the final two tracks suits Thomas, as pace brings them into focus, and clouds of minor chords send the sunbathers scurrying for cover.","Apr 29, 2016"
Pitchfork,60,"Much of Principe's second half finds him repackaging the first half with plodding disco beats that make the initially exciting melodies seem boring the second (and third, and fourth) time around.","Apr 29, 2016"

Blurt Magazine,90,"Its a seamless, flawless mix that in Moodymanns hands becomes a timeless capsule spinning across the galaxy to rally any generation that finds it.","Apr 29, 2016"
PopMatters,85,"It would be wrong to describe Moodymann's DJ-Kicks set as a feel-good mix--it's much more than that, brimming with the highs and lows that real life can offer--but it is a joy to listen to, and that in itself is plenty.","Apr 29, 2016"
The Skinny,84,"With his first officially licensed mix CD, for the 51st entry in the DJ-Kicks series, one might expect a set of dusty disco and deep house, but Dixon confounds expectations throughout, detouring at peak moments, going left where he might build momentum, all of it leading to luminous results.","Apr 29, 2016"
PopMatters,82,"It may have taken him a long time to release a mix in this way, but the quality of DJ-Kicks makes it worth the wait. At 30 selections, the tracklist is remarkably long, but nothing feels rushed.","Apr 29, 2016"
Clash Music,80,"Its an essential purchase for anyone vaguely interested in music with a soulful pulse.","Apr 29, 2016"
The Wire,80,"With the presence of so many just-off-the-map yet accessible tracks, this set serves as an entry point to a host of artists all sharing a similar aesthetic operating at different levels drawn together by an overarching understanding of how music works on multiple levels. In this, Moodymanns installment of DJ-Kicks may well become the unimpeachably perfect bar against which all subsequent sets will be measured.","Apr 29, 2016"
The Quietus,80,"Dixon judiciously edited over one-third of the tracks to facilitate flow, his craftiness most evident in the way Talc's breezy part-soft rock/part-Daft Punk hybrid melts into one of Beady Belle's graceful lounge laments. Dixon's taste dips back several decades, but he keeps it relatively contemporary all the way through.","Apr 29, 2016"
XLR8r,70,"Theres little sense of genre in an record-industry sense here. The pieces Moodymann mixes together, like the downtempo house of Daniel Bortzs Cuz Youre The One and Swedish folksinger Jos Gonzlezs mournful Remain, shouldnt work, but they keep the calm atmosphere going.","Apr 29, 2016"
AllMusic,60,"While the artistry is evident in his picks, Moodymann's execution here could've use a more deft hand.","Apr 29, 2016"

Resident Advisor,80,"The album constantly maintains feelings of loneliness and obsession, and serves equally as a soundtrack for fantasy exploration as well as late-night dancefloor enrapturement.","Apr 29, 2016"
Drowned In Sound,80,"Theres little doubt that Essaie Pas have fallen into one of the strongest electronic albums of the year so far. It may be a little backward-looking, it may be too much of a prisoner of its own fantasies, but when alls said and done, these are fantasies we can all live with, and I imagine that most of us do.","Apr 29, 2016"
Spin,77,"Demain Est Une Autre Nuit feels not just a good fit for the label's vintage-modern aesthetic, but a culmination of something. Perhaps it's simply that this weird, mannered synth music is no throwback, but merely a style ahead of its time, and one that only now is coming of age.","Apr 29, 2016"
Pitchfork,70,"In their dramatic interplay they find their lust for perversion and compulsion, as if exploring the infinite degrees of their relationship with the same piquant allure of Gainsbourg and Birkin (albeit less warm and more interpersonally brittle).","Apr 29, 2016"

XLR8r,70,"It's Venetian Snares going back to the root of his influences by means of a longer-established medium. An admirable idea well executed, but as a listener I'm just not ready for a drill & bass revival and as such this album beggars few repeat plays.","Apr 22, 2016"
AllMusic,70,"Throughout the record there's the vague notion that Funk is taking a swipe at the synth fetishism that's made modular systems achingly hip again in recent years. Traditional in essence it may well be, but it's done with arched eyebrows and a knowing smirk.","Apr 22, 2016"
PopMatters,66,"Venetian Snares albums are usually tough and intense listens, but Traditional Synthesizer Music can be fuzzy to a fault. It lacks the internal turmoil that defines Funk's best music.","Apr 22, 2016"

Q Magazine,50,"It's only when that rhythm programming is either stripped right back or broken apart that you get a sense of overabundant glee in playing with the blurts and splurts of the synth timbres, and this feels like more than the generic, albeit impeccably executed IDM record that the title rightly suggests.

The Observer (UK),75,"On Dynamics, Frankel and Millhiser made an unnatural-yet-understandable misstep, but on Crime Cutz, theyre hoping to regain their footing and play off their awkward slip by reverting back to what worked for them in the first place.

The New York Times,60,"Resort allows their promise to be condensed into a single release, and if a debut album follows soon, the momentum could take them to big things.","Apr 22, 2016"
Paste Magazine,60,"In an age where indie is a bit of a dirty word, its refreshing to hear something so seemingly guileless and uninterested in being blown by the prevailing winds.

The Skinny,62,"Opus oscillates between two poles. On the one side are entrancing progressive house numbers like the bookending 'Liam' and 'Opus.'... At the other end of the spectrum are songs informed by Prydzs pop instincts, and these can be more of a mixed bag.","Apr 15, 2016"
PopMatters,60,"Across two hours, theres plenty of dross: techno-leaning tracks lack danger, while others could soundtrack the bland aspiration of a duty-free shop. But just as he sampled Steve Winwood for his number one hit Call on Me, Prydz knows the value of a yacht-rock vocal.","Apr 15, 2016"

Drowned In Sound,76,"On first pass, A Minor Thought might sound like another Smallville record with all the expected tropes; listen more carefully and you'll hear a world of subtle tweaks and improvements. It's a beautiful illustration of the label's sound, a warm and welcoming style of house where predictability is a strength instead of a weakness.","Apr 15, 2016"
Q Magazine,75,"All 11 tracks are paced somewhere between 120 and 125 beats per minute; all of them follow pitter-patter house beats; all of them use the same palette of cool jazz samples and Chicago house basslines and warm, watery keys. But if you're a fan of this kind of thing, A Minor Thought proves that sometimes variety isn't the most important quality in an album.","Apr 15, 2016"
AllMusic,70,"Moomin is not making house for dancefloors; A Minor Thought aims for the sunrise, the morning after, the calm days devoid of storms.","Apr 15, 2016"
Consequence of Sound,70,"Each of the 11 here tracks deliver much the same mood however, and if one were to quibble, it might be to suggest that Moomin's beats strive so hard to be tasteful and inoffensive that they sometimes verge on blandness. That being said, if you love your house sepia-toned with plenty of TR808, Moomin's latest is for you.","Apr 15, 2016"

Uncut,50,"Structurally, the album makes itself up to be an emotional story, one lacking in complexities that would make such a skeletal frame have its flesh. But that facet is not easy to gauge with the bare repetitions of phrase that have little in mind but cause those reluctant to view electronic music to roll their eyes, while also making prided veterans give DJDSs effort the benefit of the doubt.","Apr 15, 2016"

Q Magazine,90,"Ritual Spirit tantalises with the promise of a staggering force should the next LP surface soon.","Apr 15, 2016"
The Wire,83,"Ritual Spirit, apart from the rapping portions (which dont detract from the experience), pores over a genre Massive Attack helped shape.","Apr 15, 2016"
The Line of Best Fit,80,"Pretty much everything that helped the band make a name for itself is on display for these four songs--the simmering tension of title track, the sample-happy soundtrack for urban decay on the opener Dead Editors, the hot and steady boil of Voodoo in My Blood, and the morose single Take It There featuring the return of Tricky.","Apr 15, 2016"
Dusted Magazine,70,"Massive Attack were always equally as good producers as they were curators; it's promising that, as much of their old sound as they've retained, they've kept this as well.","Apr 15, 2016"

The Wire,80,"There are echoes of recognisable genres here, but the overwhelming sense is of a burned-out mind, muttering freaky things to itself, as sounds fizzle and char around it. Yet somehow, as the rhythms chatter, vocoders sing hymns to deviant gods and the synths melt, it sounds like something you want to get involved with.","Apr  8, 2016"

Spin,70,"As fans of the Glaswegian producer will know only too well, the solemnity of Menzies work as Alex Smoke has always proved itself to be multi-faceted; transcending the sphere of electronic music to incorporate the multi-instrumentalists penchant for classical instruments. Fast forward to 2016 and this truth remains intact.","Apr  8, 2016"
Tiny Mix Tapes,70,"Menzies fuses his recent interest in classical work with glitchy dystopian techno, painting a nine-more-black picture that lurches between bruised James Blake and after-hours heroin party with no little elegance before ultimately losing its way in all the fog.

AllMusic,85,"It's the conflict between tension and resolve, the contrast between beauty and ugliness, and the overall uncertainty that makes this such an interesting and enthralling experience, and also one of Porter's most startling and accomplished releases yet.","Apr  8, 2016"
Pitchfork,84,"Third Law trades emotion for physical power and presence. Porter has figured out how to channel the aggression of his early material into the maturity and otherworldliness of his solo work, and it's as breathtaking as it is bruising.","Apr  8, 2016"

The Wire,70,"By focusing on his aesthetic and retaining an interest in the possibilities that exist within slow music while setting himself time limitations, Porter has created a record that is as bold and as breathtaking as we might have ever hoped for, regardless of the projection it is set to generate.","Apr  8, 2016"

Record Collector,80,"The whole thing comes off as an imaginary Tricky radio station where the DJ plays his own stuff and mixes himself into other artist's tracks, so if alternate views and unclassifiable collections are desired, Skilled Mechanics isn't a lark or a side project but a necessity.","Apr  1, 2016"

Mojo,60,"Unsurprisingly, the tracks that feature Redway's voice chopped and sampled and without straight lyrics, 'Beseech' and 'Extract,' are the most satisfying ones on the album. These two tracks point to the duo's real potential.","Apr  1, 2016"
The A.V. Club,58,"The duo's linear arrangements could keep a dance floor chuntering along, but they make for clunky pop songs.","Apr  1, 2016"
Magnet,40,"While the pair clearly have a knack for churning out catchy vocal lines--the melodies of tracks such as Borderlines feel familiar from the very first listen--Redways vocals tend to slide into an ersatz soulful drone, and the polite percussion and soft but relentless bass buzz that trundle beneath can render the songs miserably airless.","Apr  1, 2016"

Rolling Stone,80,"Armed with sounds of vintage gear recorded at a hospitable Austin, Texas instrument shop, Anand created Para in a number of locations, yet the album sounds like it was made in deep, zoned-out concentration.

Clash Music,80,"ts concise nature, glossy finish and sense of clarity (something that even extends to the band photography) suggest that, as strange as it might seem, this is not a return to Sunn O)))s metal roots, but is instead, for all intents and purposes, their pop album.","Apr  1, 2016"

Clash Music,80,"The slow roll-out of singles over the past few months leading up to its release makes Product hard to consider as a singular cohesive package, but as a primer on SOPHIE, it's as good as it gets, a snapshot of an exciting artist whose tightrope walk between sweet and scary, pop and avant-garde, has yielded some of the best singles of the past few years.","Mar 25, 2016"
Resident Advisor,80,"As familiar as many of these tunes now are, Product still sounds disruptive, a sound pushing the limits of what constitutes pop and what is just an annoying noise you are inexplicably paying money for.","Mar 25, 2016"

Spin,40,"Curiously, the tracks that smugly seem to be going out of their way to get on your nerves arent the most infuriating thing about Product.

Pitchfork,90,"The records lack of organization and resistance to stasis work against its accessibility. Those willing to mine such a dense work will be rewarded in a visceral sense, but may be left groping in the darkness for a specific, externally-fabricated meaning.

Pitchfork,70,"The downside of the now-ness, the resistance against static definition, is lack of resolution. Mutant is hard to listen to, sometimes in a salutary way and sometimes not.","Mar 25, 2016"
No Ripcord,70,"Somehow, despite the maelstrom of sound and texture, Mutant never topples in to destruction. But perhaps the fact that it does teeter that much closer to the edge is the reason that it never quite matches its predecessor's more solid appeal.","Mar 25, 2016"

Drowned In Sound,80,"DJ Paypal's take on footwork does to R&B, disco and 1980s adult contemporary smoothness what sometime collaborators AG Cook and SOPHIE of PC Music do to bubblegum ad teeny pop. [Dec 2015, p.47]","Mar 25, 2016"
Pitchfork,80,"Ultimately, Sold Out is not doing what its title cheekily alludes to. Although it traverses a variety of genres outside of footworks typical territory, DJ Paypal never relents on the actual practice of the juke: the core sound of the beat, getting danced on.","Mar 25, 2016"
The Quietus,80,"This teaser [is] no doubt just the beginning of a new strain of avant-footwork coming our way in 2016.","Mar 25, 2016"
Clash Music,79,"It's not even a requirement that you dive more than surface deep into a style before you borrow it. But Sold Out shows what a difference it can make when you hold yourself to a higher standard.","Mar 25, 2016"
Resident Advisor,75,"It wasnt too long ago that Paypal himself was working his happy hardcore fanaticism into the footwork bass lines. While those hardcore elements are non-existent on this effort, the whimsical spirit remains.","Mar 25, 2016"
Tiny Mix Tapes,70,"Its a solid album, albeit one without many ultra-impressive peaks. But, arguably more importantly, its a reimagining of footworks impressive potential.","Mar 25, 2016"
The Wire,70,"Shades of The Herbaliser's Something Wicked This Way Comes abound, and the sensation that there's some kind of malevolent presence woven through the eight songs that make up Sold Out never fully escapes you.","Mar 25, 2016"
Pretty Much Amazing,70,"In spite of the giddy playfulness, it never comes off as a lark. Youll get no closer to ascertaining his actual identity, but as the balance between jokes and earnest emoting narrows, Sold Out presents something of an abstract portrait of the man behind the haze.","Mar 25, 2016"
Under The Radar,70,"[An] engaging Sold Out.","Mar 25, 2016"

Consequence of Sound,91,"Its OPNs most emotional work to date and also his most ridiculous. Its tragedy is bound up with its humor; its sublimity comes from the places where it feels the most broken.","Mar 18, 2016"

Drowned In Sound,90,"Garden of Delete is the exceptional post-performance of the readability conjured in the wake of OPNs work, and as a result, it critiques experimental cultures desire to fetishize.","Mar 18, 2016"

Mojo,80,"As dense as R Plus Seven was cleanly sculpted, there's a lot to unpack within Garden of Delete, including its title: a phrase that suggests the meticulous task of editing music as well as the union of creation and destruction (and shortens to G.O.D.), it's the perfect mission statement for an album that combines past and present in surprising, and surprisingly organic ways.","Mar 18, 2016"

Mojo,70,"For all its challenges and provocations, Garden Of Delete may actually be more inclusive and open than it first appears. It might be that its moments of hope and beauty (Lift) linger longer in the mind than its very varied assaults.","Mar 18, 2016"
Pitchfork,70,"Lopatin still manages to stand out from the pack. Garden of Delete is another adventure watching your own sense of subjectivity drown in a pool of confusion.","Mar 18, 2016"
Consequence of Sound,60,"At its best, you can get lost inside Garden of Deletes rabbit hole of different directions and unexpected asides, but at other times its easy to feel shut-out, as if youre looking in at someones intellectual ADHD, but hes steadfastly refusing to meet your gaze.","Mar 18, 2016"

Q Magazine,80,"Seemingly out of nowhere (but actually taking three years to materialize), Bratten has crafted a spectacular, surprisingly confessional album of bone-chilling electronic music suggesting that his previous releases barely hinted at his prodigious talents as a composer and arranger.","Mar 18, 2016"
The Guardian,80,"Bratten's sound is somewhere in-between classic Trentemller and BOC's campfire melodies. By your third listen, you'll be hooked.","Mar 18, 2016"
NOW Magazine,74,"Bratten has made an expertly produced, emotionally honest record that defies genre and expectation.","Mar 18, 2016"

Magnet,80,"Rusties new album doesnt signal a reclamation of maximalism as much as its a return to form, even if its likely that many of its themes were inspired by an acid trip more eye-opening for Whyte than necessarily for the rest of us. But what a trip.","Mar 18, 2016"
Consequence of Sound,73,"There is zero daylight between the artist and his vision, as he pounds tirelessly away at one very specific idea. It is less an album than a set of 15 variations upon a single theme. It is the Rustiest album possible, and you have to respect that kind of doggedness.","Mar 18, 2016"
The Line of Best Fit,70,"The builds are huge, and heavy on detail. It helps that he's as generous with hooks as with atmosphere.","Mar 18, 2016"

Mojo,100,"Elaenia flits, swoops and soars beautifully, impossible to pin down, let alone cage.","Mar 18, 2016"
The Skinny,90,"Elaenia is fated to become one of those albums that inspires ritualistic listening parties held by small groups of audiophiles. That shouldn't be held against it.","Mar 18, 2016"
AllMusic,84,"It's a record best heard loud, because the quiet parts can be very quiet, and its spirit lies less in melodies or even moods than in tiny details.","Mar 18, 2016"
Clash Music,80,"Until the release of this album, Shepherds output might have proved hard to follow for the casual listener, comprising as it did sundry white label releases, one-offs and remixes. Fortunately, Elaenia acts as a brilliant encapsulation of a huge talent.","Mar 18, 2016"
Resident Advisor,80,"Of all albums this year, Elaenia is one that could be--probably will be--discussed for some time. Its as impressive and rewarding as you want to be.","Mar 18, 2016"
AllMusic,80,"The songs on Elaenia sound closer to psychedelic jazz and post-rock, and feel more like improvised jam sessions than carefully sequenced electronic music. It's a risky strategy, but the gamble pays off big.","Mar 18, 2016"
Spin,80,"Shepherd's flawless Eglo catalogue had the power to coax his followers off the dance floor with him, and Elaenia's sophisticated sense of musical accomplishment ought to keep them there.","Mar 18, 2016"
PopMatters,80,"All the nerding-out is secondary to the emotional pull exerted by these creeping, tickling and soaring tracks.","Mar 18, 2016"

The Guardian,80,"This is intelligent dance music (with no capital letters)--clever and warm, sophisticated and joy","Mar 18, 2016"
Resident Advisor,80,"Shepherd is among London's most sought-after DJs, known for marathon sets that span everything from disco's deepest cuts to feel-good hip-hop. But here he steps away from those club sounds in favor of a fully immersive experience that's unbounded by genre.","Mar 18, 2016"
Pitchfork,80,"What makes his debut so appealing is that Shepherd never sounds too rigidly loyal to any genre or sound, making Elaenia a fascinating and confident debut from a tenured rookie.","Mar 18, 2016"
AllMusic,80,"Eleania demands focus, too, but pay attention to it and you'll be rewarded.","Mar 18, 2016"
Exclaim,80,"As Shepherds confidence grows in his compositions, he gives each element of the song enough time to stand on its own, without the bells and whistles of the Ensembles (slightly more) enormous orchestra.","Mar 18, 2016"
Mojo,80,"An astonishing cohesive record. [Dec 2015, p.107]","Mar 18, 2016"
Resident Advisor,80,"Much here, like the outstanding 'Silhouettes (I, II & III),' sits elegantly in a progressive tradition that draws on Teo Macero's collage work on In A Silent Way, David Axelrod's string arrangements, and Four Tet's own 'Thirtysixtwentyfive.' [Dec 2015, p.71]","Mar 18, 2016"

PopMatters,75,"Elaenia stands out as a remarkably assured debut album from an artist who took his time putting it together.","Mar 18, 2016"
Drowned In Sound,70,"The album is not without its flaws, mostly coming from the disappointing length and one filler track. The record only lasts seven songs, and with the flood of ideas that Shepherd clearly brings to the table, its a damn shame we dont have more time in his world.","Mar 18, 2016"

Pretty Much Amazing,90,"Nothing finds beauty in exploring dreams of a human-free world. Kode9's strength has always been to show that serious scholarship and avant-garde instinct don't need to separate from dancefloor culture and here, he's made one of his clearest statements of that yet.","Mar 18, 2016"
PopMatters,80,"The word 'empty' aptly describes how this album feels, and that could potentially alienate listeners, but it captures the (absence of) feeling dead-on, and it contains some of his most compelling productions yet.","Mar 18, 2016"
Pitchfork,80,"Despite the sense of loss that inevitably pervades the music here, Steve Goodman's first solo effort as Kode9 also charts out some exhilarating new directions. [Dec 2015, p.74]","Mar 18, 2016"
Mixmag,80,"Nothing continues his lifes work to twist and distort. To invert boundaries and genres and do more. Yes at times it seems like theres a little something missing. Yes at times it could use something more. But there is and it could. Its called Nothing. Sometimes thats the point.","Mar 18, 2016"
PopMatters,80,"Nothing is a stark record, and I imagine not one that will be ringing out of club PAs on a regular basis. Instead, it joins the impressively swelling ranks of dance/techno/electro/house albums that reflect the inner workings of the individuals creating them.","Mar 18, 2016"
Pitchfork,78,"The mechanistic form and function can feel totally lifeless, but there's a layer of mourning beneath the gleaming metal.","Mar 18, 2016"
AllMusic,76,"The most complicated forms of techno and footwork are built simply, from the ground up, and on Nothing, we hear the simplicity of each component and how it all comes together to make the music that we love.","Mar 18, 2016"
The Quietus,70,"Nothing has afforded him unlimited space to recalibrate after a period of upheaval and loss. [Nov 2015, p.45]","Mar 18, 2016"
Clash Music,70,"Despite its conceptualist sonics and firmly placid surface, Nothing still winds up as Kode9s most unsettling and miserablist release to date, as well as his most emotionally resonant and straightforward.","Mar 18, 2016"
Uncut,70,"Even by Hyperdubs standards--a 20-year lineage of beats birthed and incubated in Londons most soot-smeared corners (grime, dubstep) and Chicagos windwept streets (footwork)--this is not a light record.","Mar 18, 2016"
The 405,70,"It's clear that the death of his good friend and musical partner affects Kode9 on a deep level, making Nothing one of the most honest and emotionally challenging electronic releases in recent memory.","Mar 18, 2016"
Resident Advisor,60,"Using multiple, often unsystematic rhythmic modes, this alien mood is sustained, though when Kode9's late lyrical foil The Spaceape makes a spectral appearance in the fleeting Third Ear Transmission, you're reminded of how much he contributed. [Dec 2015, p.109]","Mar 18, 2016"
Pitchfork,60,"Ultimately, as a standalone record, Nothing feels somewhat incomplete.","Mar 18, 2016"

AllMusic,100,"This is an exquisite interpretation of an exceptional album.","Mar 18, 2016"
Spin,90,"Vulnicura Strings sees Bjrk restructuring an already phenomenal work of art and creating an even more desolate mood than the phenomenal Vulnicura, where time is frozen but also somewhere to move on from. Its not a place to visit every day, but whenever you need a reminder about what great art looks and feels like heres where to go to.","Mar 18, 2016"
The Quietus,80,"This reinterpretation of Vulnicura is a success that also surprises, given the simplicity of the premise. This is both a joy to listen to and a chance to focus on Bjrks string arrangements and the frustration contained therein.","Mar 18, 2016"
XLR8r,80,"Vulnicura Strings probably isnt an album youd want to listen to much on a regular basis, despite its undeniable excellence. It does, however, make for a beautiful and fascinating companion album to one of the years very best records.","Mar 18, 2016"
Exclaim,70,"A satisfying, if not earth-shattering, experiment. [Jan 2016, p.73]","Mar 18, 2016"
Mixmag,68,"A lot of these songs didn't have hooks, per se, to start with. They expanded and contracted with a kind of cosmic swarm, the percussion providing a delicate skeleton. Loose as it was, without that punctuation, Vulnicura Strings can feel a little formless.","Mar 18, 2016"

PopMatters,80,"Tan remains aloof and introspective, still murmuring about lonely walks and cigarettes, but now there's a swagger and verve to his production. [Jan 2016, p.75]","Mar 18, 2016"
The Wire,80,"With Many Colours, Tan proves that whatever happened over the past decade which meant we didnt get any music from him, it only made Many Colours a stronger, and ultimately a more enjoyable record.","Mar 18, 2016"
Tiny Mix Tapes,75,"Colder has no intention of redefining or reshaping the electronic music world with Many Colours. Instead, Tan seems more interested in seamlessly adding his saturnine musical textures to the growing sonic palette of the modern club scene, while also reminding us all just how on point and of the moment his sound continues to be.","Mar 18, 2016"
The Line of Best Fit,60,"This disc represents a decent, very listenable attempt at updating that picture. It is however, a relatively small album, overlooked both by predecessors from the new wave era and by more recent, lofty stadium takes on the sound.","Mar 18, 2016"

No Ripcord,82,"What Burton nails on Communion is how to fold in sounds from all over--electronic music and the real world--to make powerful and terrifying music in 2015. If the club is a shelter from an oppressive and dangerous society, then Communion is what waits outside.","Mar 18, 2016"
AllMusic,80,"A haunting debut, Communion finds Rabit living up to his potential in stark, beautifully ugly and angry ways.","Mar 18, 2016"
Drowned In Sound,80,"While hes tugging at strings that have been otherwise picked up by the stable of Berlins PAN (M.E.S.H., Helm, and Visionist) or his Tri Angle labelmates past and present (Arca and Lotic), his extreme repetition of these familiar sounds pushes them euphoric.","Mar 18, 2016"
Q Magazine,80,"While dancing to his music may prove difficult, absorbing and enjoying it in other ways is certainly very easy.","Mar 18, 2016"
Uncut,80,"For some Communion will be too discordant, too warlike, too brutal to their sensibilities, a direct threat to their notions of what is 'beautiful' in their world. But the chrome plated harshness of Rabit's music brings out a different form of joy, a pleasure that comes from catharsis, frustration, and alienation.","Mar 18, 2016"
The Guardian,79,"Communion plays out like a kind of fever dream, a delirium of cold sweat and disturbing visions in which there are only brief moments of daylight before you're plunged back into the maelstrom once more.","Mar 18, 2016"
Resident Advisor,70,"Can feel somewhat alienating, but worth sticking with. [Dec 2015, p.76]","Mar 18, 2016"
Record Collector,70,"There are a few tear-out moments (see the unhinged 'Black Gates' and the volatile 'Burnerz'), but the biggest rewards come from more alien and introspective moments such as 'Glass Harp Interlude'.","Mar 18, 2016"

Mixmag,75,"Outside the relative intensity of City Dweller, sample-heavy Do My Thing and Pulse, Gently and Deep Breathing provide musical sorbets between the action. Its some of the softest production Saginaws put out before, and is a welcome break on the tightly-spun ep.","Mar 18, 2016"
AllMusic,70,"Though it might not be as substantial or as neatly tied together as No Better Time Than Now, the EP is easy to enjoy and full in form.","Mar 18, 2016"
Exclaim,70,"By providing himself with a narrow set of parameters, hes discovering what hes capable of in a less-than-optimal creative environment, and if Intermission is anything to go by, a protracted lay-off from Ghostly releases whilst he pursues other avenues would be a real shame--nobodys capturing that midnight mood quite like Shigeto at the minute.","Mar 18, 2016"
Resident Advisor,60,"Although there are no real revelations on Intermission, Shigeto demonstrates yet again what he does best.","Mar 18, 2016"

The Guardian,80,"Her best album-length-EP since Quarantine remains instrumental, but now skitters jazzily.","Mar 18, 2016"
XLR8r,74,"Live manipulation gives In Situ its textures, as Halo hardly lets a few bars go by without tweaking rhythmic elements, introducing new sonics or briefly leaning on an effect. The movements are unpredictable but never distracting or overwhelming.","Mar 18, 2016"
AllMusic,70,"You can definitely hear her thinking her way through each track, treating each as packets of sound, to be observed and experienced in a loop.","Mar 18, 2016"
Spin,70,"Quietly fascinating, reaffirming that Halo doesn't have to make a grand statement to deliver another intriguing addition to her body of work.","Mar 18, 2016"
Tiny Mix Tapes,60,"The energy sustained here comes only from scientific curiosity at the permutations offered by a piece of hardware, and it doesnt really connect beyond that.","Mar 18, 2016"

AllMusic,80,"This second effort even has the edge on 2012's The Light The Dead See, with an extra-dazzling cinematic sweep to its orchestration, a poleaxing depth to its existential sorrows and a fabulously redemptive uplift in the climatic My Sun. [Dec 2015, p.107]","Mar 18, 2016"
Resident Advisor,80,"Powerful and affecting, this is as good as anything Gahan has done in the last 25 years.","Mar 18, 2016"
Clash Music,70,"The two entities continue their tear-jerking relationship on this year's Angels and Ghosts. Once again, Gahan has turned himself inside out on these songs.","Mar 18, 2016"
Mojo,70,"Whereas The Light the Dead See was a simple addition of Gahan's lyrics to the Soulsavers' music, this is a fully cohesive collaboration, with both artists sharing songwriting credits on all songs.","Mar 18, 2016"
Uncut,70,"The schmaltz only sometimes gets the better of them ('The Last Time' drags after the somber 'Lately'). Gahan has always sounded like a complex individual with Depeche Mode, but on this set, he sounds set free.","Mar 18, 2016"
Spin,60,"Angels & Ghosts wont draw you in immediately and it does contain several lumbering, repetitive tracks that neither move nor entertain. But after a few listens, you may begin to see the light.","Mar 18, 2016"
AllMusic,60,"Angels & Ghosts is in many ways accomplished and often very pretty. But its pretty in the way of a postcard, and Gahans been around long enough and been through enough to warrant something deeper.","Mar 18, 2016"
musicOMH.com,60,"It's a muscular and alluringly saturnine record with a vintage sheen, which occasionally tilts at the Bad Seeds but sounds more like a wracked Richard Hawley. [Dec 2015, p.71]","Mar 18, 2016"
The Guardian,60,"For Gahan, Angels & Ghosts is another opportunity to repeat his therapeutic cycle of guilt-shedding and redemption. [Dec 2015, p.88]","Mar 18, 2016"
Q Magazine,60,"Angels & Ghosts default position is the doom-laden, mid-paced ballad. Gahan sings with unsparing emotional commitment against Soulsavers canvas of gospel-tinged backing vocals, ghostly organ and big minor chords.","Mar 18, 2016"
Mojo,57,"Angels & Ghosts isn't a bad record, but it's frustratingly tepid.","Mar 18, 2016"
Uncut,50,"Plodding, overwrought gospel epics like Shine and Tempted are the order of the day, pale passionless shadows of the Modes mighty, desperate Condemnation.... Things improve on the starker latter half.","Mar 18, 2016"

Drowned In Sound,90,"Replaying Under The Same Sky enough times reveals balanced interplay between heavy warehouse techno and increasingly noticeable individual craft.","Mar 11, 2016"
Mixmag,80,"Li's productions tend toward a functional minimalism that works well for DJ singles but to some ears might lack the dynamics expected from albums. If you can get past that, though, Under The Same Sky holds together as a compelling exploration of a theme.","Mar 11, 2016"
The Skinny,72,"Under The Same Sky might not be the most original or ambitious album you will hear this year, but it's arresting, it moves quickly and it never looks back.","Mar 11, 2016"
Q Magazine,65,"Each track of Under the Same Sky will undoubtedly find a home in a record bag or set list somewhere, and rightly so, as there's really nothing fundamentally wrong with any of them. As an album, though, Under the Same Sky leaves you wanting more of a moody, immersive experience, and less of its clean surfaces and precise negative spaces.","Mar 11, 2016"

Uncut,70,"If it feels just a little patchy in places compared to its predecessor, it's hard not to be jerked into life by this band's approach to the dancefloor's dark bidding. Just don't over-think it.","Mar 11, 2016"
The Observer (UK),70,"As If contains more dizzying peaks and valleys than a Zorb ride through Derbyshire (and leaves you twice as exhausted). Possibly the most fun you'll ever have once before throwing in the towel and doing something valuable with your life.","Mar 11, 2016"
AllMusic,69,"As If  leans a little too heavily on the groove in the middle, with moments like 'Funk (I Got This)' fading into the background, but it's reinvigorated towards the end by the riveting 'Lucy Mongoosey', which uses another singalong chorus as an anchor, an introspective pause among all the dancing.","Mar 11, 2016"
Boston Globe,65,"It just isn't a consistent !!! album. But if it's any consolation, As If is still brimming with the ecstasy and feeling of freedom that you'd expect to be promoted by the band at this stage in their near 20-year lifespan.","Mar 11, 2016"
PopMatters,60,"Brash, wearyingly loud and very funky, As If certainly isnt lacking in emphasis, but will likely disappoint if youre searching for a little more.","Mar 11, 2016"
The Guardian,60,"Its a shame the editing isnt as tight all the way through, but these grooves sure are deep.","Mar 11, 2016"
Under The Radar,60,"They're now coming across as though they're seriously indecisive, unable to take their upbeat dance-punk to its extremes. Tellingly, As If takes off when the group remove their vocals from centrestage. [Nov 2015, p.69]","Mar 11, 2016"
Drowned In Sound,55,"As If is just another glimmer of something that may never be.","Mar 11, 2016"

Spin,80,"On Life, Friel doesnt venture too far from his own post, but does prove himself yet again as more than a mere dial-twiddler, a virtual dungeon master that plots campaigns with sound instead of words.","Mar  4, 2016"
Exclaim,80,"Life isn't exactly a concept album about becoming a parent, but it's clear just how much the experience has changed Friel, as it captures all of the excitement of first time discoveries and all of the possibilities that lie ahead, which in turn makes the music feel like his most innovative and playful yet.","Mar  4, 2016"

NOW Magazine,80,"Tape Loops is open and expansive, and finds Chris Walla leaving interpretation up to the listener. Is it sad? Zen? Contemplative? In any case, it's both a veiled and a starkly honest communication.","Mar  4, 2016"
Drowned In Sound,70,"Even though Tape Loops feels cold and wintry and with a hint of melancholy or regret, it's still a soothing, reflective, refreshing listen.","Mar  4, 2016"

AllMusic,50,"When listened to as ambient noise, the album adds a layer of elegiac beauty to its surrounding environment, but when listened to intently, it presents a frustrating experiment, a Mbius strip of perpetual return.","Mar  4, 2016"
Billboard.com,40,"The shift in sound is subtle at best, and only the most astute listener will sense any real progression. At times its lovely to listen to, but all in all it best serves as somnolent sounds for insomniacs.","Mar  4, 2016"

AllMusic,60,"Real Life is a compendium of 90s references, an avowed musical homage. This approach can sometimes feel a bit cold and diffident, and the monotone vocals also undercut the mood. But for all the talk of raves, drugs and A-road pubs, the recurrent theme is love, and monogamous love at that.","Mar  4, 2016"
The Line of Best Fit,60,"Real Lies are too young to remember the late 80s, but the north London trios frisky debut album is steeped in the spirit of the Balearic years when indie kids discovered ecstasy and acid house.","Mar  4, 2016"
Exclaim,40,"Real Lies debut effort instead puts forward a group whove clearly agonised over every detail of their early 90s aesthetic, and forgotten about the songs in the process.","Mar  4, 2016"

The Observer (UK),90,"Howl is a well-crafted structure, built on the foundation laid by its predecessors. It's certainly the pinnacle of West's career so far, and up there for electronic album highlight of year.","Mar  4, 2016"
PopMatters,80,"With compressed mechanical wheedles circling each other like birds on Ghosting and the self-explanatory Morning Vox, the machines pumping through Howl are the most organic youll hear all year.","Mar  4, 2016"
Pretty Much Amazing,80,"It is the sharpness, leanness, and absorption in detail found on Howl that combine to make it a success. Its not impossible that it could ultimately out-shine a lot of the bigger names it has been pushed up against this year.","Mar  4, 2016"
Under The Radar,80,"It is the album's ability to create such an immersive experience with relatively few constituent parts that makes this Ryan Lee West's finest release to date.","Mar  4, 2016"

Consequence of Sound,77,"The soundscapes he's constructed on his third LP, Howl, are spiky and imposing, too solid to sink into. The music is always shifting, so it's impossible to lose track of time while listening.","Mar  4, 2016"

Pitchfork,70,"Blanket Waves asks for your attention, and suggests you try soundtracking your own life with its echoes of joy and terror. It's not a cop-out to say that this is music which needs to be infused with human experience.","Mar  4, 2016"
Consequence of Sound,70,"Overall, the release is a surreal, unpredictable excursion, and it finds the duo continuing to venture further outside the styles of their main projects, tapping into their subconscious minds in order to create striking dreamscapes.","Mar  4, 2016"

The Wire,40,"Ephemeral, blissful, ambient.... Its also a mess. But it chooses to be a mess. It tries to be a mess thats smoothed over and therein genius should reside. But it hasnt done that. Instead all that is presented is two overlong tracks of snippets of stuff.","Mar  4, 2016"

The Quietus,80,"Whereas 'Hey Go' claws at cabaret crushed velvet, and 'Officers Club' funks Scruffily, 'Manalog' is the sole, slightly noodly odd one out on an album of big punchlines, defrosted drum breaks snapping necks like breadsticks, and foibles for the eagle-eared to pick out listen after listen","Mar  4, 2016"

The Line of Best Fit,80,"It's an album of disco sadness, dry ice cut by lasers enabling glimpses of people dancing in with tears in their eyes.

The New York Times,70,"A little bit of restraint goes a long way for Keep Shelly in Athens, as their second album retains the creative spirit that made their early EPs so intriguing without succumbing to the dramatic, overbearing impulses that bogged down their first album.","Feb 26, 2016"
Under The Radar,60,"There are many moments of magic on Now Im Ready although its reverent, over familiarity with its ancestry sometimes exposes its Achilles Heel. Keep Shelly in Athens clearly know all the right moves but perhaps need to reveal a bit more of themselves.","Feb 26, 2016"

Resident Advisor,80,"Heartache City has much more in common with the bands first two albums, the freakiness of their folk here is undeniable, but the tracks all share a strong backbone of hip hop and afro-beat which elevates them above the streamlined pop melee.","Feb 26, 2016"

Exclaim,60,"Many of the guests are of the squeaky-clean variety--Ella Eyre and Sinead Harnett will be deemed edgy by almost no one  while two Lianne La Havas-sung numbers tackle bossa nova (Neednt Speak) and slinky disco (Breath). Still, Rudimental know when to light the fireworks.","Feb 26, 2016"

Resident Advisor,70,"Approach it as a much more relaxed, refined, and ethnobeat version of St. Germain.","Feb 19, 2016"
The Wire,60,"As with Tourist, its possible to feel these combinations are a little too smooth; its also possible to feel uneasy about a white European appropriating black musical styles.

The Line of Best Fit,70,"Production wise, [Have] You In Wilderness is a touch too diaphanous and gauzy, a few tracks in, you start craving something solid to hold on to amid the clouds of billowing strings.... It's a testament to Holter's songwriting ability that this doesn't fatally mar the album, but it would be appreciated if her future work demonstrated a greater sense of its own physicality.

Drowned In Sound,80,"Although the tracks rarely surprise, frequently falling back on familiar sounds and structures -- loping basslines and synthesizer shadings that escalate at the same tempo always arrive on time, for instance--they're as well-built as those of the debut, and the Lawrences, along with their songwriting partners, cover the ups and downs of falling in and out of love in sharper fashion.","Feb  6, 2016"

AllMusic,60,"Thankfully the big-name guests step up to the plate, specifically Miguel on the hazy Good Intentions; the Weeknd, who continues his pop trajectory on Nocturnal; and Lorde, who slinks playfully around Magnets subtle electro shuffle.

Q Magazine,82,"At almost 70 minutes, Where All Is Fled may take a few unnecessary detours across its 14 tracks, but it's ultimately Hauschildt's most cohesive work.

Q Magazine,70,"It's a pleasure to hear the trio working in this way, especially given the sonic common ground they share with Fennesz, and it's also the most energised I've heard the latter sound for a while. Nonetheless, the lack of friction between their respective musical aesthetics can't help but make me wonder how King Midas would sound in collaboration with another, less likely, fellow traveller.","Feb  5, 2016"

Exclaim,80,"As the whole, though, Discreet Desires is more introverted than Hauff's previous material. She's attempted to present a unified piece with this album, rather than a selection of similar tracks, and it's a gambit that's paid off in spades.","Jan 22, 2016"

The Neo-Realist (At Risk) remains the strongest aspect whilst the singles and outtakes feel more like filler.

Resident Advisor,85,"20 is a summary, a quick history lesson, and a celebration building upon itself. It might bypass some of Planet Mus finest momentsinstead, the compilation aims to highlight the history of artists most likely to be around for Planet Mus future.","Jan 22, 2016"
Q Magazine,80,"20 gives this now-classic label the classy tribute it deserves.","Jan 22, 2016"
Uncut,80,"As varied as this all may sound on paper, just keep in mind that Planet Mus most listenable artists are already pretty far into left-field from the start. So when 20 hops from one stone to another, it feels like youre following a path of some sort.","Jan 22, 2016"
Under The Radar,70,"It's fair to say with such as varied collection of sounds from disparate sources, 20 doesn't make it easy on the listener. After spending two hours of being buffeted by a dizzying array of beats and sound textures, listening to the third CD, with its wilful experimentalism, was almost too much on the first listen.","Jan 22, 2016"

Mojo,70,"For the most part, Silicon works, delivering strange sonic pop candy that feels a bit too distant to warm the heart, yet is strangely comforting in its isolation.","Jan 15, 2016"
The 405,70,"Yet although it lasts barely half an hour, it feels as if the album doesn't quite cohere into a convincing whole, and that the first half's captivating energy is lost amidst one too many hazy, half-formed slow jams later on. Even so, a hugely promising debut.","Jan 15, 2016"
Clash Music,70,"With only ten tracks, half of which are under three minutes long, Personal Computer feels just a few bits short of a byte and you may well find yourself moving straight onto Unknown Mortal Orchestra's back catalogue just to get some closure.","Jan 15, 2016"

Q Magazine,60,"Theres no doubt that his first LP as Silicon is the work of a talented multi-instrumentalist and songwriter, one who will only go from strength to strength.

Under The Radar,80,"Perhaps theres not that one killer single that will turn her into an instant sensation, and those are bound to emerge, but what shes cultivating with Georgia holds more value: that of creating an essential body of work that is unaware of any imperfection, coming from a mind thats overflowing with a glut of ideas.","Nov 20, 2015"
Sputnikmusic,80,"Its a credit to her craft and attention to detail, the resulting offering is sonically and musically expansive, drawing from a wide range of sources and reconciling disparate genres and musical traditions into a cohesive whole that serves as the perfect soundtrack for the halfway mark of the 2010s.","Nov 20, 2015"

Drowned In Sound,70,"It's palpable that the tracks are more at home on the stage, where you can feel the frenetic energy of the record itself, Georgia's boisterous on-stage persona coming through in abundance.

AllMusic,70,"Love Is Free sits strangely in the canon of Robyn. Its euphoric, and like every great Robyn anthem, theres a cry-while-you-party type sound on the mini-LP thats intensely emotional but wields an undeniable kinetic streak.","Nov 13, 2015"
Q Magazine,70,"The record works as just five songs.","Nov 13, 2015"

Billboard.com,73,"Much like the techno of yore, Persuasion serves its primary purpose as dance music, but is also intelligent, experimental, and above all, fun--all qualifiers that many of Blondes' compatriots could learn a thing or two about.","Nov 13, 2015"

Resident Advisor,80,"Its use of frayed tones and frequencies as the organising basis for movement and propulsion allows the music to seep into the cracks and pores of the space around you, extracting the anxiety and dread inherent hidden in our world around us.

Clash Music,80,"Risveglio seems keen to be accepted on its own terms rather than a simple curio. This it warrants, and rewards patient listening.","Nov 13, 2015"
Chicago Tribune,72,"Despite the noise and murk, it's easy to listen toonce you're a minute into one of Risveglio's songs, you pretty much know what it is and where it's going. It's music that is alien and strange, but also familiar.","Nov 13, 2015"
Drowned In Sound,70,"The component parts are limited and austere as always (though this time hes added on a Roland bass synth to his instrumental palette), which makes it all the more impressive that hes able to conjure such brilliance out of them.","Nov 13, 2015"

The Wire,90,"Whipple's previous PAN release, the Scythians EP, hinted at the greatness to come from this Janus club night co-founder, yet was a little too short to really demonstrate his true power. It took a full-length release to truly suss out the immensity of M.E.S.H.","Nov  6, 2015"

Uncut,80,"While the music he creates on Universes is not quite from another planet, theres definitely a spirit of exploration that makes it a joyous listen throughout.","Nov  6, 2015"
Pitchfork,80,"Universes builds on that vibe [of a late-night P.A. set] with exuberant bangers full of snappy, discofied drums, repetitive phrases and dusty funk that could fit nicely into a DJ set of classic Philly soul re-edits or slickly produced tracks from the current UK garage revival.","Nov  6, 2015"
Drowned In Sound,80,"Universes is not quite grasping the heights of the Horsehead Nebula, but the novelty of Seven's poly-genred bravura certainly leaves it reaching in that direction.

Consequence of Sound,60,"Davis still sounds best when sticking to the instrumental mode of his thumping 2014 PARTY EP. Nonetheless, Universes is a warm, danceable introduction to an artist with plenty of sonic tricks up his sleeve.","Nov  6, 2015"

New Musical Express (NME),80,"All Tense Now Lax at times evokes luminaries like Coil or early Current 93, but ultimately exists as its own beast, one that is never predictable, always challenging and achieves that oh-so-rare feat in rock music now: it turns the genre inside out and pulls the remains into a brave new form of noise.","Nov  6, 2015"

PopMatters,70,"Born In The Echoes does not reveal anything startlingly new about The Chemical Brothers, but it is more than them simply ticking over, and clearly they have an eye on the future.","Oct 30, 2015"
Record Collector,70,"Tracks [like Just Bang and Reflexion] that, while groovy and undeniably fun, ultimately feel as stripped away and shallow as the modern pop-electronic sounds the Chemical Brothers actively avoid. Luckily, this doesnt prevent Born in the Echoes from feeling like a well-rounded record.","Oct 30, 2015"

Pitchfork,60,"The latest from the U.K. duo hits harder and lower than their last album, 2010's Further, with guest-vocal turns from artists as varied as Q-Tip and St. Vincent over tracks that could've torched an outdoor rave in 1995.","Oct 30, 2015"

Drowned In Sound,83,"While the midtempo tracks veer into the noodle-sphere, the lush Magnifique proves theyre not a dance-floor novelty.","Oct 30, 2015"
The Wire,83,"The precise beauty of their production work, specifically the refusal to dump gratuitous instruments into the mix, places Magnifique at the top of Ratatats catalogue. Stroud and Mast let guitars beat at the albums heart, and their balance of bubbly and peaceful elements ushers a return too fluid to ignore.","Oct 30, 2015"
Boston Globe,80,"Magnifique doesn't show a ton of artistic growth or progression; it's more of a rebranding that tightly focuses on their strengths and passes them to the consumer like a sharp, swift punch to the brain and feet.","Oct 30, 2015"

Mojo,70,"Even where his pieces feel unscripted and accidental, they all manage to paint a doomy melancholy which has a filmic charm.","Oct 16, 2015"
Spin,70,"Unpredictable and ruthlessly abstract, Pattern of Excel is possibly the most avant-garde release in Ninja Tune's long history, and may seem like a stark departure from Lee Bannon's earlier works, but it's really just a continuation of his tendency to follow his fearlessly creative spirit into uncharted territory.","Oct 16, 2015"
Mojo,68,"For an album with a swimming pool on its cover, it doesnt exactly submerge you in its sonic layers. Rather, its a wade through the shallow water heading to the deep end of the pool.","Oct 16, 2015"
Resident Advisor,66,"Pattern of Excel is similarly idiosyncratic--it feels, in many ways, like a fistful of sketches torn from the notebook and tossed to the wind. Making sense of the ways they fall is part of the pleasure of this quiet, cryptic record.","Oct 16, 2015"
Pitchfork,65,"It's a loosely coherent mood piece that, despite (mostly) maintaining a murky, somnambulant vibe, nevertheless leapfrogs around an impressive scrapheap of refurbished ideas. [No. 122, p.55]","Oct 16, 2015"
Mixmag,60,"The 15 songs are relatively short by ambient standards, which makes the album feel like a collection of sketches.","Oct 16, 2015"

AllMusic,60,"Pattern To Excel emerges in fragments, almost painlessly, with every inch of space filled, all the darlings still written.","Oct 16, 2015"
New Musical Express (NME),50,"Sadly, Bannons ambient music struggles with a staggering lack of presence that his heady breakbeat programming never failed to accentuate.... The rest of Pattern of Excel seems to follow that trajectory toward more acoustic and gloomy sounds, by far the most effective section of the album, though not exactly innovative.","Oct 16, 2015"

Q Magazine,80,"Theres no shortage of potential DJ weaponry on Homesick, but what makes the album truly impressive are the cuts where Matrixxman gets out of his presumed comfort zone and steps away from the club.","Oct 16, 2015"
The 405,80,"The album offers a fresh perspective on minimal techno, keeping things energetic and more than a little bit apprehensive.","Oct 16, 2015"
No Ripcord,72,"Homesick is not quite a concept album, but there's a ghost of a narrative visible in the record's bookending tracks.","Oct 16, 2015"
PopMatters,70,"It can arrest large scale arenas, and Matrixxman's Swiss Army Knife game is indisputable, though it's often used as a plot twist that's not necessarily relatable to the original story.","Oct 16, 2015"
The Independent (UK),60,"Homesick is a rocky album with songs stretching too long for their same-sound focuses.","Oct 16, 2015"

The Guardian,50,"These carefully manicured, melodic songs are much too transparent and lightweight, though, to leave much of an impression.","Oct 16, 2015"
The Line of Best Fit,40,"The artist widened his palette this time, bringing in the country singer Jake Owen on one track, and soul star Aloe Blacc on a song that aims to repeat the magic Blacc struck on Aviicis Wake Me Up. Unfortunately, Youngs nerdy sensibility kills that.","Oct 16, 2015"

Pretty Much Amazing,70,"Across its 14 tracks, Fingers, Bank Pads & Shoe Prints twitches with endless inventiveness and energy, finding Boo tinkering with vocal snatches as frequently as he skews the beats into ever-more queasily unusual formations, drawing from soul, soundtracks and classic dance music along the way.","Oct 16, 2015"
The 405,70,"Fingers, Bank Pads, and Shoe Prints is a much harsher, more trying listen, but well worth the effort, at least as a frame of reference.","Oct 16, 2015"

New Musical Express (NME),75,"Bones is a remarkable, chameleonic entity.","Oct 16, 2015"

Spin,70,"Son Lux's remix value is through the roof, settling nicely along the lines of Purity Ring's debut, The xx, or even some of Thom Yorke's solo tracks. That said, each of these examples are revered, but not lived up to.","Oct 16, 2015"
Consequence of Sound,60,"Though Bones is almost as dramatic as a standard week on Albert Square--occasionally to its detriment--its also impossible to fault this albums single-minded pursuit of sheer, maxed out saturation.","Oct 16, 2015"
AllMusic,60,"Theres so much bone-crunching texture that it claws your ears like a gnarled kitten. Past the theatrical dins of songs like Flight and This Time, though, there are simple pleasures in the cinematic darkness of I Am the Others and the folksier Undone, which strikes a balance between complex rhythms and alluring acoustic guitar licks.","Oct 16, 2015"
The Quietus,50,"If Bones is too densely packed to inspire, at least thats a good quality for a foundation to have.","Oct 16, 2015"

New Musical Express (NME),80,"Moonbuilding 2703 AD, like many other Orb albums, is tailored for the close listener in all of us--not to pick up on the details themselves, but to witness the many details interacting with one another as they wash over you in a mental state of zero gravity. They did it again, those guys, and it will put you over the moon.","Oct 16, 2015"
Resident Advisor,80,"Ultimately Moonbuilding 2703 BC is an immersive, imaginative journey into the unknown that, unfortunately, won't end up being the space travel concept album of the year. Public Service Broadcasting have already locked that down. Top marks for effort though.","Oct 16, 2015"

Pitchfork,70,"It's never quite a tour de force, but as a union of the Orb's heady roots with their spiritual ascendants' minimalist ethos, the album is a consistently satisfying groove machine, and a worthy entry to the upper ranks of the Orb canon.","Oct 16, 2015"
Exclaim,70,"The record is made up of four nine-minute-plus epics that waft into view, all dub basslines, ambient synth washes and well-chosen samples. The exception to such rambling--and standout moment--is the title track.","Oct 16, 2015"

The Wire,50,"The skill involved in composing and producing A Paradise is not in question, but a little less cerebral meandering and bit more fun really would go a long way here.","Oct 16, 2015"

Tiny Mix Tapes,80,"Lantern is a beautifully restrained--by HudMo standards, that is--concept album that mirrors a full day, yawning awake with palate-clearing drones and ending ecstatically in the wee hours of a club utopia.","Oct 16, 2015"
The Quietus,80,"Where Butter sounded like he downloaded every idea in his brain into the music, this is more concentrated and immersive; the 13 intricately sculptured songs inform one another and cohere into a complete work.","Oct 16, 2015"
The Observer (UK),80,"It's a dazzling trip. [Jul 2015, p.108]","Oct 16, 2015"
musicOMH.com,80,"There are points on Lantern where you wish hed give the bloody mindedness a rest. More often, it proves his point: the strange, beguiling sound of man neatly evading whatever pigeonholes hes been shoved in.","Oct 16, 2015"
NOW Magazine,80,"Lantern is this duality between experimental and easily-grasped embodied. Unsurprisingly, it is the more left-field elements to the production that are the most intriguing.","Oct 16, 2015"
The Quietus,80,"Overall, Lantern's a beguiling collection of songs from an artist whose road to success is made better by the number of detours he takes along the way.","Oct 16, 2015"
Mixmag,75,"Where the album certainly succeeds, though, is in its crafting of a colorful, if a tad overlong, mission statement for a producer still only beginning to approach the extent of his potential.","Oct 16, 2015"
Resident Advisor,75,"The beats are luminous, the melodies enlightening, and, most importantly, the record is guiding a path to much brighter things for the producer.","Oct 16, 2015"
Pitchfork,74,"Lanterns risk-taking is daring and giddy, but its favored mode, and Hudson Mohawkes best, is hooky, crowded, rap-conscious electropop.","Oct 16, 2015"
Uncut,70,"Slightly unfocused by design, Lantern broadens HudMos repertoire while also reaffirming his status as the premier producer of the sound that brought him to fame.","Oct 16, 2015"
Drowned In Sound,70,"HudMo has toned down the high contrast and adopted a softer, soul/R&B-pop style. [Jul 2015, p.77]","Oct 16, 2015"
Clash Music,70,"Its refreshing to see an EDM producer balancing his more hedonistic impulses with genuine artistic ambitions, especially when its done with such a consistent energy and purpose.","Oct 16, 2015"
The Guardian,70,"Cleaned up, brightened and simplified, the album is a fine showcase for Mohawkes preppy sensibilities while remaining a singular, auteuristic remedy to todays faceless (and toothless) EDM superstars.","Oct 16, 2015"
Exclaim,70,"The 14-track effort staggers in its breadth, especially since the album never loses its central through line: his knack for spinning pretty, heavy, and pretty heavy tracks.","Oct 16, 2015"
The Wire,70,"A relatively disjointed assembly of tracks seemingly drawn from working folders labeled like 'athletic anthems,' 'theatrical intros and interludes,' 'almost pop,' 'space ballads,' and 'misc.'","Oct 16, 2015"
Drowned In Sound,66,"When Lantern hits its high points, it ends up somewhere in the stratosphere. When it falters, it's mostly because it's too ambitious, either thematically, as with the overblown love songs, or technically, as with the roller-coaster sequencing that halts the momentum over and over.","Oct 16, 2015"
Dusted Magazine,60,"The problem is that Birchard spreads himself so thin in his rush to tick off all the stylistic boxes, some songs sputter into half-realized clich.","Oct 16, 2015"
musicOMH.com,60,"Lantern still shows clear signs of the producer attempting to find his feet, if at times faltering.","Oct 16, 2015"
Uncut,60,"The monster beat shell games of 'Scud Books' and 'Portrait of Luci' show why his jams are a hip-hop gold standard. The vocal takes impress less decisively.","Oct 16, 2015"
AllMusic,60,"Although Lantern strains more than a few sinews, trying to show everything Mohawke can do (sensitive soul remakes, apocalyptic digitals) theres room for raw touches such as Lil Djembe, which recall the trap beats that made HudMos name.","Oct 16, 2015"
Pitchfork,50,"We really want to like Lantern for its originality; its bravery and its attempt to grasp a genuine uninhibited euphoria that isn't easy pull off. Sadly it just misses the mark way too often and leaves you with fleeting glimpses of what could have been a very exciting album.","Oct 16, 2015"
Dusted Magazine,40,"Even as it completely eschews Mohawke's maximalist, hyperkinetic style of old for a newfound soft side, Lantern registers as a limp, populist gesture for how ham-fistedly it attempts to reconcile the two. [No. 122, p.57]","Oct 16, 2015"
The Quietus,20,"Lantern comes off like Birchard wallowing in an uncharacteristic and blissful tedium.","Oct 16, 2015"

Sputnikmusic,70,"Portraits establishes Maribou State as an intriguing pair of sonic architects, capable of crafting intricate but not cluttered, blue but not depressing, emotive electronic pop music.","Oct 16, 2015"
Exclaim,70,"Portraits is a successful attempt at an album steeped in tranquility that can also keep you moving.","Oct 16, 2015"

Magnet,80,"While Meridian continues on logically from Dream Sleep, and even Barn Owl's V, it is at another level, one more inherently focused and more overtly compositional. This is Caminiti's most holistic project to date.","Oct  9, 2015"
Uncut,80,"What elevates Meridian above the throngs of similar abstract, mod-synth ambient records are the same sensibilities that carried albums like Dreamless Sleep, even if the tools are different this time around. Tracks that, for the most part, sound formless--never careless. [No. 121, p.53]","Oct  9, 2015"
Under The Radar,70,"If it is difficult to find fault with Meridian, it is also difficult to find reasons to choose it over more accomplished and extraordinary music of a similar kind.","Oct  9, 2015"
Magnet,70,"The unpolished, unpredictable nature of Meridian is certainly part of its charm, one way or the other. There are a lot of cinematic drone albums out there, and the organic, human touches here lend this one more personality than most.","Oct  9, 2015"
The Observer (UK),70,"Some of the songs may even leave you thinking they could use another element, but in the end, it's nice that they remain as spare as they do, the edges left soft and fuzzy, the way you see things in the dark.","Oct  9, 2015"

AllMusic,82,"Since the beginning, DJ-Kicks has been about finding unique takes on this craft. Kozalla's 50th instalment more than lives up to this tradition.","Oct  9, 2015"
Clash Music,80,"A passive listen to Kozes Kicks might just reveal hip-hop love and brilliant talent, but the underlying theme from Koze is simple, but easy to overlook: a genuine love of music.","Oct  9, 2015"
The Quietus,80,"Koze finds home for these misfit songs, and by doing so gets you thinking about possibilities, what else that might be out there waiting to be rediscovered.","Oct  9, 2015"
Under The Radar,80,"His incorporation of lo-fi house and cosmic techno uplifts through the smallest dosage, and induces a powerful stupor until you're out the other side, perching on a Balearic mountaintop.","Oct  9, 2015"
The Independent on Sunday (UK),70,"When Koze finally gets around to mixing in some house tracks, they're midtempo and bittersweet rather than high-energy floor fillers, and uniformly excellent, particularly Frank & Tony's sublime 'Bring the Sun. One wonders how astonishing the mix would be if it had consisted entirely of tracks like this, but the variety is refreshing, and Koze's adventurous spirit is always admirable.","Oct  9, 2015"

Boston Globe,100,"LP (2015) is a short and sweet affirmation for the faithful.","Oct  2, 2015"
The Telegraph (UK),80,"LP might be Ren Schofield's shortest album as Container, but it's also the one that best captures the full elemental force of his music.","Oct  2, 2015"
Mojo,80,"There is no being taken on a conceptual journey, or losing yourself in these tracks. They overwhelm and punish your ears and synapses, disappearing before you get a chance to acclimatise yourself. Asymmetric guerrilla dancefloor bangers in effect.","Oct  2, 2015"
New Musical Express (NME),80,"All of Container's recordings are amazing, but this one is his most concentrated burst of energy yet, and it cements his status as one of the most exciting and inventive artists in the underground American electronic music scene, as well as one of the most successful in merging noise with techno.","Oct  2, 2015"
Pitchfork,80,"On LP, Container shows his ability to create a complete barnburner of an album in the least flashy and showy manner possible.","Oct  2, 2015"
Consequence of Sound,75,"The moments where things sound like theyre spilling over, bleeding outside of the track's imaginary lines, are when LP is most thrilling.","Oct  2, 2015"

Rolling Stone,90,"It is exceedingly rare to find a producer who does so much, with so little, that he distilled from, again, so much.","Sep 25, 2015"
NOW Magazine,90,"Its 42 minutes are comparatively modest, sure, but theres no question that the man behind the boards here has his finger on the pulse of what may be missing most in electronic music right now--a central reference point. In Colour is that star, the record to hold everyone elses narratives together.","Sep 25, 2015"
The Guardian,90,"This isnt dewy eyed nostalgia all weighed down with rose tinted reverence, though: he makes a respectful nod to the past by rifling through jungle and garage and so on, but each track feels like a poignant and yet propulsive reflection of Jamies personality and experiences.","Sep 25, 2015"
Uncut,90,"In Colour stands tall as a bold and renewably-exciting triumph.","Sep 25, 2015"

The Observer (UK),80,"More than a simple change in direction, this debut album feels like the culmination of pretty much everything he's done up to this point in his career.","Sep 25, 2015"
Spin,80,"It may seem dismissive to write the album off as a stepping stone, but when you consider the stark contrast between tracks like the gospel leanings of 'I Know There's Gonna Be (Good Times)' and, say, 'Basic Space,' In Colour isn't only a necessary listen, but an important one too.","Sep 25, 2015"

Consequence of Sound,80,"In Colour is no mere sepia-tinted nostalgia trip.... it is also about the pleasure of being alone, enveloped in bass, in a sea of many; of refracting what can often be a superficial experience--London clubbing--into something more existential, more nuanced, more unified.","Sep 25, 2015"
Resident Advisor,78,"While the tale and methods of In Colour are well-worn, Jamie XX, like Burial and Four Tet before him, proves himself a master storyteller.","Sep 25, 2015"
Rolling Stone,75,"True, a few tracks will bore the casual listener by hewing too closely to standard house music. For the most part, however, Jamie xxs probing of the past produces some intriguingly useful parts for an intimate style of electronica that is all his own.","Sep 25, 2015"
XLR8r,60,"In Colour breaks no new ground to be sure, but as an accessible crossover record it does a perfectly serviceable job. It's light, breezy and pretty, as ephemeral as the exhilaration of clubbing without really evoking the thrill of it all.","Sep 25, 2015"

Q Magazine,70,"If it often gets over on mood rather than message, Gibson turns out to be an impressively good mood guy, and the production (by Gibson and Randall Dunn) gets the details right, making Carnation sound like a middle-of-the-night album for a man whose sense of style is matched only by his knack for poor choices.","Sep 25, 2015"

Drowned In Sound,70,"Why Make Sense? executes one of the bands strongest selling points: their ability to marry the physicality of a rock gig with the colorful sonic palette of electronic music....

Exclaim,90,"On paper, then, the concept of an album that comes so consummately out of this context may not be the most appealing. In reality, Herndon's second full-length proper, Platform, which does just that, is one of the best records you'll hear this year.","Sep 18, 2015"

Q Magazine,87,"Despite the wide scope of her project, Herndons ambitious efforts are appealingly multifaceted and personal, and Platform may turn out to be the most thought-provoking experimental electronic music release of the year.","Sep 18, 2015"
Q Magazine,85,"While still creating boundless, exceptional fringe-pop, on Platform Herndon is finding countless new ways to hold our attention: deploying a greater sense of narrative, an emboldened melodic arsenal and enough enthusiasm to remind us why she remains a vital voice in peripheral pop.","Sep 18, 2015"
Uncut,80,"Platform is full of beautifully corrupted, synthesised signals.","Sep 18, 2015"
New Musical Express (NME),80,"Just as Holly Herndon's debut album Movement had abundant layers in its title alone, its follow-up Platform is just as nuanced in how it combines political, technological and structural and ideological concepts into a single word.","Sep 18, 2015"

Consequence of Sound,70,"Holly Herndon is far too conceptual to ever really merit banal classification as a techno or electronic producer, and with a bigger platform (intentional), she shows that her vision opens a multitude of possibilities that go beyond genre. Platform isnt the album to realize that potential, so obvious since Movement, but its a tantalizing taste of the future.","Sep 18, 2015"
Pitchfork,70,"Its structurally confounding, simultaneously weirder and more welcoming than any of the other material shes released to date.","Sep 18, 2015"
Absolute Punk (Staff reviews),70,"In a way, on Platform too, theres just too much control on the artists side and not enough room for engagement on the listener end. Still, Herndon is just setting to work as a musician, and shes already pushing her sound well beyond the experiments of the 20th-century avant-garde.","Sep 18, 2015"
Uncut,60,"It doesnt always work: Lonely At The Top is a minimalist, spoken-word piece set to odd clicking noises that doesnt really bear repeated listens. For the most part, however, this is a brave, forward-thinking collection that will be required listening for any fans of electronica.","Sep 18, 2015"
No Ripcord,60,"In its least engaging moments, Platform feels more like a homework assignment geared to some equivocal set than an album. In its better moments, its electronic music for the fourth-dimension.","Sep 18, 2015"

PopMatters,90,"Ratchet is one of the most purely pleasurable records Ive heard so far this year, and one of the strongest debuts in several years.","Sep 18, 2015"

AllMusic,89,"Ratchet gambles at every turn and comes up a major player.","Sep 18, 2015"
Resident Advisor,88,"Ratchet refines the rawness of the EP only slightly, its punky minimalism echoing some of the outsider edginess evinced by early '90s house innovators such as Green Velvet.","Sep 18, 2015"
NOW Magazine,83,"Ratchet isnt an unqualified triumph. But the album doesnt have to be perfect to be a success. Its highs are high enough that its lows can be forgiven, or forgotten entirely.","Sep 18, 2015"

AllMusic,80,"Evolution will silence all but the omnivores, and Shamir has the right taste buds. But he also has a great voice, a stunning countertenor that some have mistaken for female.","Sep 18, 2015"
Exclaim,80,"Shamir's marriage of club-pop and dance music is striking, if hardly revolutionary on the surface. But the devil-may-care ease with which he plays with his sexuality and dances through the drama pushes the record into the sublime.","Sep 18, 2015"

Clash Music,80,"In a year thats seen the heavyweights of the industry fannying about with abstract release plans and bickering over streaming services, Shamir has swept through and delivered a record that schools every one of them in the art of purest pop.","Sep 18, 2015"
Mojo,80,"Shamir is unquestionably the star, but the interplay between artist and producer is palpable; its a musical match made in heaven (or, perhaps, hell: Sylvester has likened his role to the relationship between the poet Virgil and his protagonist Dante), and the finest moments here have Sylvester providing the trampoline for Shamir to bounce on.","Sep 18, 2015"
Uncut,80,"This combination of pop and disco makes Ratchet the perfect summer soundtrack.","Sep 18, 2015"

PopMatters,70,"Odd that 'Beautiful Now' goes from horny ('I see what you're wearing/There's nothing beneath it') to Maroon 5-esque (the cloying 'ba, ba, ba-ba, bah!' chorus), but otherwise the slick and skillful True Colors is built for fans of Zedd's music rather than his social media followers.","Sep 18, 2015"
Pitchfork,70,"Ultimately, Zedds True Colors shows the guy is brilliant at what he does, and for those who want to get all in their feelings on the way to a festival or to soundtrack a beach date with bae (or a group of friends), this will be the disc to keep on repeat.","Sep 18, 2015"
Clash Music,60,"On True Colors, each track tries to be a separate statement as Zedd tries to crash through his own, pre-existing glass ceiling--but the whole falls short of the sum of its parts.","Sep 18, 2015"
AllMusic,60,"Though he cycles through a major-label budget's worth of sounds and vocalists (including Selena Gomez and earnest rapper Logic), Zedd's colors are often hard to tell apart.","Sep 18, 2015"
Tiny Mix Tapes,42,"True Colors does traverse familiar, populous formats that may be difficult to innovate on top of, but other posi-tinted, mass audience-focused projects have found success by mixing their own cocktails of EDM, soul, and of-the-minute rap production.

Mojo,80,"Murphys music remains grounded in Hercules & Love Affair-style housey electronica but these songs unfurl slowly and unconventionally as they take detours into skulking Grace Jones funk ('Uninvited Guest), opulent cosmic disco (Evil Eyes) and lush country balladry ('Unputdownable').","Sep 11, 2015"

Tiny Mix Tapes,100,"Entanglement is an album that needs to be considered alongside genre heavyweights like The Blue Notebooks by Max Richter or Englabrn by Jhann Jhannsson. Its a timely reminder of how high modern classical music can reach.","Jul 31, 2015"

AllMusic,70,"Portico have certainly succeeded in reinventing themselves, and they sound like a completely different band to Portico Quartet. The flipside of this is less positive: with their synth textures and post-dubstep influences, they dont sound all that different from much of the pop music being made at the moment.","Jul 24, 2015"

Mojo,60,"Add the way 'Roadblox' provides the cinematic side of Prodigy that's often overlooked and the album seems a triumph, but lead single 'Nasty' is a lesser 'Firestarter' and at 14 cuts, this chunky effort is built for returning fan club members and not the EP-craving EDM crowd.","Jul 24, 2015"

Drowned In Sound,75,"Insides is Fort Romeaus second full-length record, and although it doesnt continue on quite the same upward trend of his recent discography in the risk-taking department, it does boast some of his most fully dimensional and impressively produced work yet.","Jul 17, 2015"
The Quietus,70,"There arent any tidy four-minute bangers ready to assault the dance floor on Insides, but with so many DJs doing that already, its all the better that Fort Romeau doesnt feel the need to compete.","Jul 17, 2015"
PopMatters,68,"The gussied-up politeness that has followed Greene throughout his career is still an issue here, making the less adventurous material sound slightly anonymous.

Mojo,65,"The newness of it is exciting, and so is the fullness of his vision; between the narcotic mood and the omnipresent murk, Dream a Garden suggests a maze-like expanse within its borders, perfect for getting lost in. Unfortunately, the album only partly lives up to those promises.","Jul 10, 2015"

PopMatters,90,"In its breadth of ambition and stunningly realised sounds, Dark Energy delivers more than just a new twist on an established style. Remaining tightly linked to the music of Jlin's forebears and contemporaries, it nonetheless maps out an inspiring and tantalising glimpse of electronic music's future.","Jul 10, 2015"
Uncut,85,"Dark Energy has all the hallmarks of footwork--its frenzied pacing, arrhythmic kick drums, a graphic command of blank space--executed with clear-eyed self-determination. This gives the album an opaque, thoughtful quality.","Jul 10, 2015"

Q Magazine,70,"It's almost a back to basics approach.","Jul 10, 2015"
Clash Music,70,"Instead of trying something new, he focuses on what he's good at, which makes Claustrophobia a lateral move rather than a step forward. It seems Rose is trying to recapture the brilliance of his peak-period work. In Claustrophobia's best moments, he does.","Jul 10, 2015"
AllMusic,70,"It's not the spartan techno of the early SCB records by any means, but the never-quite-convincing progressive window dressing has mostly been thankfully thrown out said window in favour of an approach that maintains big room impact without pandering to its more simplistic tropes.","Jul 10, 2015"

Paste Magazine,80,"The record is alive.

The Observer (UK),60,"While the form may feel familiar (think: a glitch-pop kissing cousin to Rufus Wainwrights days as a balladeer, or a soft-shoe version of Patrick Wolfs orchestral manoeuvres) a promising left-of-centre choice sets Fyfe apart from the pack of crooners.","Jul 10, 2015"

Uncut,70,"Producer Corin Roddick crafts stark tracks that find a middle ground between lustrous synth pop and the plush, cavernous hip-hop of hot producers like Mike Will Made It.","Jun 23, 2015"
Blurt Magazine,70,"The pair largely eschews such so-called guffaws on their sophomore effort, another eternity, but they display a willingness to more intrepidly embrace the pop underpinnings of Shrines.","Jun 23, 2015"
Mojo,70,"This brooding, almost gothic feel is the key to this albums success, and proves that Purity Ring are far more complex than their surface lacquer of innocence may have led us believe.","Jun 23, 2015"
AllMusic,70,"Another Eternity is a far more mainstream-sounding album than their 2012 debut Shrines, but its also rooted in sounds from the underground.","Jun 23, 2015"
Resident Advisor,67,"The album is good, which is a component never worth underscoring. But it could be much more than that.","Jun 23, 2015"
Pitchfork,67,"Another Eternity seems more focused on entertaining large masses of people than creating meaningful art. Thats all fine and good, but that sort of cash and popularity grab might prove that all that past skepticism was well-placed.","Jun 23, 2015"
PopMatters,66,"This obsession with connecting and disappearing in rapid succession is fitting for a record that finds Purity Ring trying to stake their claim at pop's center but ultimately retreating within themselves.","Jun 23, 2015"
XLR8r,65,"This feels like little more than a competent game of catch-up for three years away, with Purity Ring now following in the footsteps of others, in a genre where they once led the pack.","Jun 23, 2015"
AllMusic,63,"As it stands, its hard to call anything on this album an evolution, since many of the tracks feel like they're just more beefed up but far less interesting versions of what they gave us on Shrines.","Jun 23, 2015"

The Wire,60,"After a debut that spent much of its time slinking like crawlers out in the shadows, its intriguing--if slightly disconcerting--to see Purity Ring in a warmer light.","Jun 23, 2015"
Resident Advisor,60,"In the end, another eternity leaves us somewhere in the middle, to contemplate the excellent and the bland.","Jun 23, 2015"
PopMatters,55,"James and Roddick clearly have their sights set on mainstream success, but are instead in danger of sounding like one of the many pretenders that their first album spawned, rather than smart, subtly innovative band they once were.","Jun 23, 2015"

Rolling Stone,85,"Late Night Tales is a beautifully constructed, cohesive compilation of tracks which proves the ascension of Jon Hopkins to the highest level was no fluke.","Jun 22, 2015"
Magnet,80,"Even the contrasting consecutive picks--like Darkstar's glistening, skyward 'Hold Me Down' and Holy Other's dragging, alien 'Yr Love'--are compatible, their transitions made with ease. The majority of the mix is beatless and becalmed with periodic surges in energy that never startle.","Jun 22, 2015"
Pitchfork,75,"This is an inspired collection of songs, even if you do get the feeling Hopkins prefers to spend his late nights alone.","Jun 22, 2015"
Rolling Stone,70,"It's a real labour of love where every track has not only been meticulously thought about and placed, but it's clear that Hopkins has thought tirelessly about how it fits into the wider picture of the collection as a whole.","Jun 22, 2015"
PopMatters,70,"Approaching this project as a commissioned artist would, Jon Hopkins' Late Night Tales feels more like a narrative than it does a simple mixtape.","Jun 22, 2015"

Mojo,80,"Even at five tracks, Heterocetera is a strong, visceral electronic record that maintains its ambition and intensity from beginning to end.","Jun 16, 2015"
Q Magazine,80,"Heterocetera is packed with writhing climaxes and blistering comedowns that leave you gasping without ever being able to forget who is behind them. Of course, confronting these contrasts remains a provocation on the artists part, but only ever in the best possible sense.","Jun 16, 2015"
Exclaim,80,"Heterocetera is more than a worthy successor to Damsel in Distress--it's some of Lotic's most exciting music.","Jun 16, 2015"

The Guardian,64,"SOL has less gravity when it steers away from its majestic solar themes and tries to put its abstract sensations into words. Eskmo's vocals, while delicate, still feel intrusive.","Jun 16, 2015"
XLR8r,60,"SOLs awakening moments are defined more by what is absent rather than what is present.","Jun 16, 2015"
The Observer (UK),60,"The relatively sparse ambient instrumentals, frequently unpredictable as they twist and turn, are almost as fascinating. Even the relatively tranquil sections seem slightly turbulent.","Jun 16, 2015"

PopMatters,80,"Brava has a unique voice, one that's choppy, quirky, welcoming, and likely smells of blunts when it burps.","Jun 16, 2015"
Clash Music,80,"A hazy, seductive blend of trap and techno, it feels like the soundtrack to a strip club in Paris' grittiest arrondissement.","Jun 16, 2015"
AllMusic,40,"As it stands, Brava is mostly just a reminder that Brodinski helped plant the seed but is perhaps not the right gardener to helpp it grow.","Jun 16, 2015"
Mojo,40,"A blunt genre deserves a blunt assessment so, for what it's worth: in reflecting his mixtape interests, Brodinksi is well on his way to mastering one of the year's most disposable albums.","Jun 16, 2015"

Resident Advisor,80,"A 2015 update of Model 500 with a dark, industrial overcoat would be as unbearable as similarly ill-considered evolutions from other artists, and in sticking to his ground Atkins resolutely retains his strengths.","Jun 16, 2015"
Mixmag,80,"The clunkier, funkier patterns mapped out here have something proufound to say about the relationship between us and our technological world, about where our dancing and moving bodies fit in among the conurbations and databanks of our lives. [Apr 2015, p.57]","Jun 16, 2015"

Record Collector,80,"The music carries you along, building to a very gradual crescendo that feels like Popol Vuh stretching out one Phil Spector moment for three-quarters of an hour. [No. 118, p.53]","Jun 15, 2015"
New Musical Express (NME),80,"Experimental music inevitably engenders pretentious music writing, yet when it's as good as Behold it creates a listening experience that altogether dwarfs any linguistic rationalisation. This is a record of light and shade, and one that demands your fullest immersion.","Jun 15, 2015"
The Line of Best Fit,76,"The music evolves so gradually, it's easy to find yourself wondering how you've wound up at a given point; there's a sense of traveling without moving, of zooming in and out between broad strokes and pinpoint details, toggling between distracted reverie and close attention.","Jun 15, 2015"

Uncut,70,"The combination of pop and EDM is nothing new, but rarely has it felt quite so enjoyable as it does here.","Jun  9, 2015"
Pitchfork,70,"Lesser guests are occasionally lost amid the restless drums and ricocheting synths. For listeners, though, getting lost in these tracks is half the fun.","Jun  9, 2015"
PopMatters,70,"There's no instantaneous party classics on Jack   no worthy successors to 'Turn Down for What' despite its obvious influence, but maybe a 'Bubble Butt' or a 'Big Bad Wolf.' As a guileless continuation of the escapist, dub-tinged blowout that Diplo effortlessly pursued with Major Lazer, it's one of the beatiest prizes of the year so far.","Jun  9, 2015"
AllMusic,70,"The end result is a love letter to the world of feels, and a great escape for heads looking to let their freak flag fly.","Jun  9, 2015"
Exclaim,70,"Yet although much of it coasts along on autopilot, it can be outrageously good fun.","Jun  9, 2015"
Resident Advisor,68,"While Jack  doesn't exactly roll the ball forward, or do much else to make listeners rethink the principal actors here, it's dumb, loud fun from two architects of the dumbest, loudest fun of the 2000s.","Jun  9, 2015"
Under The Radar,60,"Generally speaking, the Jack  project is fully functional party music that hedges its bets with collaborations and does little in the way of genuine innovation.","Jun  9, 2015"
The Observer (UK),60,"There are moments of interest on every song--the undulating vocal riff and little sonic pops that pepper Mind, for example--but nothing coalesces quite as well as Take  There. Unfortunately when the songs dont work, the formula becomes so glaringly obvious.","Jun  9, 2015"

The New York Times,80,"Rich and disorientating, KOCH accesses a different pace of life--or rather several, bewilderingly, all at once.","Jun  9, 2015"
Uncut,72,"At times, KOCH is so microscopic it feels like theres barely any place left for this music to go. But Gamble keeps finding new ways to take it apart and reassemble it, to the point where something so closed off, so concerned with the smallest of gestures, feels thrillingly open.","Jun  9, 2015"
Exclaim,70,"Koch feels like a merger of the two [Diversions 1994-1996 and Dutch Tvashar Plumes], backsliding into the dance timbres of yesteryear, and their hissy, ever moody dissolutions become predictable. [Oct 2014, p.63]","Jun  9, 2015"
The Quietus,70,"Gamble is a dab hand at sound design and creating textures that convey anxiety and paranoia--some tracks are smothered in hiss--but because of its sprawling length, parts of KOCH feel rather one-dimensional. [Nov 2014, p.75]","Jun  9, 2015"
AllMusic,70,"While the Actress tracks were, by most accounts, club tracks exposed to organic erosion and presented in sequence as an endurance test, KOCH is more bizarre and less aggressive.","Jun  9, 2015"

Drowned In Sound,70,"Its a record that, despite all of its differing hues, manages to come across as a unified mosaic of sound.","Jun  8, 2015"
Uncut,70,"Amid all this diversity, Abaporu is a remarkably steady work, with Boratto's consistent sound palette and knack for melody running strong throughout.","Jun  8, 2015"
Exclaim,60,"Taken as a whole, Abaporu isn't a bad LP, and for fans of classic Kompakt records by the Modernist, SCSI-9, or even The Field, the album might be exactly what they're looking for. More adventurous listeners, however, are advised to look elsewhere.","Jun  8, 2015"
Resident Advisor,60,"Like much of Boratto's previous work, it's all superbly crafted but not much of it leaves a lasting impression.","Jun  8, 2015"
The Wire,60,"At 13 tracks and close to 70 minutes in length, Abaporu just contains too many (albeit many terrific) ideas and stylistic flourishes to properly cohere as a singular work.","Jun  8, 2015"

AllMusic,80,"Despite the immediacy and urgency of its public genesis, Tomorrows Modern Boxes is probably the least immediate album Yorke has been involved with to date. Like Kid A before it, it may turn out to be one of his most enduring.","Jun  1, 2015"
The Wire,80,"Theres a distinct lack of choruses, and if you dont like the rest of Yorkes ouvre it would be kind of bizarre if this won you over.

Tiny Mix Tapes,80,"Free of statements and the mans desire to make every record some kind of grand manifesto, Tomorrows Modern Boxes is a mini-triumph thats only occasionally tarnished.","Jun  1, 2015"
The Quietus,75,"It's not a radical upheaval and it's nothing especially new--at least as far as Yorke's output is concerned-- but then it doesn't have to be; he's been pioneering an often-unique sound for so long now that I'm just happy to have some other songs to listen to.","Jun  1, 2015"
Exclaim,70,"The results may indeed be reflections of Yorkes skill and sensitivity, but as compositions, they are self-contained and fully anticipated creations whose power to surprise or displace the listener has waned.","Jun  1, 2015"
Pitchfork,70,"The result is a curious mix: a subtle and often beautiful record about not very much at all.","Jun  1, 2015"
Uncut,70,"As ever with Yorke's solo work, it's at its best when the loveable tyke is going with the flow instead of deliberately trying to sabotage his own ear for melody, or trying to bugger up a voice that should just make peace with the fact it's quite pretty.","Jun  1, 2015"
Magnet,70,"At times its sketchy and frail, at others decidedly defiant.","Jun  1, 2015"
Delusions of Adequacy,70,"In the end, Tomorrow's Modern Boxes is undeniably enjoyable, acting like a 2014 version of The Eraser and adding some new Thom Yorke material to your music collection never hurts.","Jun  1, 2015"
Consequence of Sound,70,"On the new album, Mr. Yorke is both instantly recognizable and less crowd-pleasing than ever. But for anyone whos stayed with him this far, its worth following him further into the murk.","Jun  1, 2015"
Mojo,70,"Its hardly love at first listen.... Yet across repeat plays, the albums charms begin to unfurl.","Jun  1, 2015"
The Line of Best Fit,70,"Yorkes meditations on the modern make Boxes thoroughly listenable but uneven. The albums first half is noticeably more coherent and accessible than the challenge and trouble of the second movement.","Jun  1, 2015"

Dusted Magazine,80,"Whilst it is true that Aphex Twins delicate and more minimalist side is neglected on Syro, save for the piano kiss-off of aisatsana (102), there are plenty of signs of James maturing and developing as an artist.","May 26, 2015"
AllMusic,80,"At times, the whirl of ideas threatens to spin out of control, but more often, as on CIRCLONT6A, they cohere thrillingly. A welcome return.","May 26, 2015"
Pitchfork,80,"Admittedly, Syro will probably not win over a new generation of fans like the Richard D. James album once did, but as a continuation of everything that has made Aphex Twin compelling, it's a triumph.","May 26, 2015"
Drowned In Sound,80,"Graying snobs once called this 'intelligent dance music.' Even now, few do it better.","May 26, 2015"
The Guardian,80,"Low on frenetics, Syro is anchored by rotund and agile basslines that zip and glide, and it's decked in accents and melodies that are lively even at their most distressed.","May 26, 2015"
AllMusic,80,"Overall, its a collection primarily concerned with the somatic rather than cerebral sides of Richard Jamess music, overdosing somewhat on staccato, bouncing synth twangs and jittery drumnbass beats.","May 26, 2015"
Uncut,80,"By sounding simply like a series of Aphex Twin tracks, Syro is still utterly engrossing and remains, somewhat unbelievably, on a completely different planet to almost anything else thats been released over the last decade and a half.","May 26, 2015"
The Observer (UK),80,"Its an effortless comeback, then, that almost plays like a greatest hits set.","May 26, 2015"

Resident Advisor,80,"While the trap state of mind may be a bleak one, it makes for a stunning piece of music.","May 19, 2015"

AllMusic,73,"The tracks on Remembrance dont sound like theyd be improved with people spitting over them, but they do connect to the emotional world of a certain kind of rap production, with chords and patterns that suggest tension, danger, and, ultimately, melancholy.","May 19, 2015"

Dusted Magazine,70,"Not everything sticks. Some of the lazing tracks verge on rudderless meandering, but as a whole, Shaker Notes is a fascinating detour.","May 19, 2015"
The Guardian,60,"There still feels like the same ratio of hit and miss that you might find in a twenty track White release. But when there's half as many tracks at twice an instrumental's length, it means those tracks you don't get on with rather overstay their welcome.","May 19, 2015"

Pitchfork,70,"Driven as equally by abstraction as by hooks, Pulsars e Quasars does not bury pop underneath noise, it marries the two loosely, and the record holds together well because of that looseness.","May 19, 2015"

Mojo,90,"Unflesh is a bold and assertive statement for what pop music can do in 2014.","May 19, 2015"

Drowned In Sound,70,"Gone are the solemnly brooding Knife-like synthscapes and the ethereal soprano.

The Wire,70,"Tamborellos mutated electronics and instinctive composition is on full display on Human Voice, so even if its a little modest, interested listeners are sure to be touched by something on the record; for a genre so often criticized as cold and detached, thats worth celebrating all on its own.","May 18, 2015"
The Observer (UK),68,"Human Voice gently nudges him back into the spotlight to speak his mind alone, and even if his voice isn't the most exciting and innovative one in today's electronic music landscape, it is unmistakably his own.","May 18, 2015"

Uncut,80,"Its an album that will make your heart swell with joy in a club or will make your lip quiver with emotion on headphones in your bedroom. There are few dance producers who possess the skills to harness both these feelings and John Maclean has managed this masterfully here.","May 12, 2015"

The Guardian,74,"In A Dream is Maclean and Whang's most fruitful, balanced partnership, and if it fails to truly make a star out of either of them, it cements them as the kind of ever-evolving collaboration DFA was built on.","May 12, 2015"
Q Magazine,70,"In A Dream is certainly not going to alienate those who adored The Future Will Come, yet it should be said there are notable points of evolution--most importantly Whang's prominence and the diversity of Maclean's songwriting. But it is difficult to place this above The Future Will Come, as despite the brilliance that Whang radiates throughout, there are up to three songs that sap momentum with their lack of vim.","May 12, 2015"

Slant Magazine,80,"The results are truly thrilling, mechanized dance for a post-industrial age.","May 12, 2015"
Drowned In Sound,80,"On Punish, Honey, Gainsborough has stepped up his sound design, but he's done so with a newly brutal approach. One hopes that he hasn't entirely abandoned his earlier, more atmospheric sound, but as career turning points and transformations go, this album is an accomplished one.","May 12, 2015"
New Musical Express (NME),80,"It all makes for riveting listening for anyone willing to let Vessel punish--and reward--their ears.","May 12, 2015"
Pretty Much Amazing,80,"The compositions here are solid, but it's sonically where Vessel holds his own. In that regard, Punish, Honey is close to perfection.","May 12, 2015"
The A.V. Club,75,"Punish, Honey moves forward powered by the tension between what it keeps hidden and what little it shows.","May 12, 2015"

Under The Radar,60,"Vessel's ambition has exceeded his abilities. By trading in his synth for sheet metal he has lost out on what caused people to stand up and take notice.","May 12, 2015"
Absolute Punk (Staff reviews),60,"Gainsborough seems to be testing not only what his crude instrumentation can withstand, but also his listeners. For all the physical exertion though, the album sounds surprisingly sexless and apathetic at times.","May 12, 2015"

The Wire,60,"It's SMD's overstated attempt to take the listener on a journey that is the album's drawback. In the end Whorl feels overlong, and the excitement and variation of the first two thirds of the album eventually dissipates into a somnolent slog.","May 12, 2015"
The Quietus,60,"Given the atmospheric and diaphanous makeup of most of the tracks, along with titles such as 'Casiopeia' and 'Redshift,' Whorl is more likely to enhance stargazing than to provoke movement.","May 12, 2015"
Uncut,60,"Its refreshing that the most appealing parts of Whorl are when the duo abandon exactly the musical nuances theyre known for. At the very least they should be applauded for exploring new territory, even if the overall record is not entirely satisfying.","May 12, 2015"

AllMusic,80,"Using a finite set of equipment to create these seven tracks, much of EX comes off strikingly similar in sound, but Hawtin being the staunch veteran that he is, uses it to his advantage, reusing and appropriating signature tones and modes to craft the most solid live set you weren't lucky enough to attend.","Apr  7, 2015"

NOW Magazine,80,"In sound, composition and performance, Sia captures the melodrama of teen life, with all the lunatic exaggeration it deserves.","Mar 31, 2015"
Clash Music,80,"While her latest album wont satisfy everyones musical tastes, it displays the work of an artist who has an undeniable knack for writing massive, anthemic melodies, and for crafting lyrics that display more emotional resonance than is typically found at the top of the Billboard charts.","Mar 31, 2015"
Exclaim,80,"Her knack for heart-swelling choruses shines through on a set of tracks you might play while winning a marathon.","Mar 31, 2015"
The Line of Best Fit,80,"It's an album designed for playing late at night; even peppier tracks like the popping-piston 'Burn The Pages' and the jittery 'Hostage' have a darkness to them. That darkness might not make Sia the world's hugest pop star, but it sure makes her one of its more compelling ones.","Mar 31, 2015"
Q Magazine,80,"Its not the triumphal, laminated, computer-perfected tone of Sias clients. Its the sound of the loopy, unresolved passions that can still be alive within pop formulas.","Mar 31, 2015"
Uncut,80,"No surprise then that this first solo album following her second wind is full of exquisite craftsmanship.","Mar 31, 2015"
The Line of Best Fit,80,"1000 Forms of Fear should be the vessel that rockets the singer out of relative obscurity and into the stratosphere populated by those more recognizable stars who've come to dominate the pop-music universe thanks, in part, to her songwriting skills.","Mar 31, 2015"
Q Magazine,80,"To say it's her most accessible album yet doesn't diminish it or her previous albums; instead, it's the sound of Furler owning her success.","Mar 31, 2015"
musicOMH.com,80,"Just consider it a solid project from an artist who, after creating albums since the late-90s, is finally getting her recognition in front, instead of behind the curtain.","Mar 31, 2015"
Under The Radar,75,"1000 Forms of Fear benefits too from the singers squeaky, scratchy vocal tone and from ear-grabbing production touches by her creative partner, Greg Kurstin.","Mar 31, 2015"
Drowned In Sound,75,"Fear shows off her ear for stentorian melodies, her quirky way with lyrics ('I'm your groundhog/And I'm skating on thin ice,' she sings on 'Cellophane'), and her astonishing voice, with its unplaceable accent.","Mar 31, 2015"
PopMatters,70,"Fortunately, these successes do not overwhelm 1000 Forms Of Fear, with tracks such as Big Girls Cry and Fire Meet Gasoline more than matching the output of her past clients in terms of captivating, powerful pop.","Mar 31, 2015"
AllMusic,70,"True, most of the themes on 1000 Forms of Fear are pretty generic, but Sias lyrics are bold and visceral, and the production is dynamic without being gimmicky.","Mar 31, 2015"
Exclaim,68,"Its an album that acts as if simply existing was success enough. Yes, it is successful in this light, but it could have still tried to be more.","Mar 31, 2015"
The Line of Best Fit,67,"Though her new material is of mixed quality, Sias instrument remains uniformly magnificent. She executes vocal cartwheels throughout these twelve songs, delivering great pain with even greater triumph.","Mar 31, 2015"
Drowned In Sound,60,"This is a top 40 pop record after all, and thus errs toward deafeningly loud vocals that occasionally obliterate some of the years smartest pop songwriting.","Mar 31, 2015"
PopMatters,60,"The production on the album is very shiny and polished, but at times far too cut and paste as every chorus seems to be layered with Sia's vocals, providing a backing falsetto.","Mar 31, 2015"
Pitchfork,60,"Furler's lyrics do tend more towards generalities than specifics, but there are penetrating looks here at love's mind games (Fair Game), and being saved (Cellophane).","Mar 31, 2015"

Record Collector,60,"While Sia deserves stardom, 1,000 Forms of Fear is so sonically flawless and contemporary-sounding that its impact may fade with time.","Mar 31, 2015"
Uncut,50,"1000 Forms Of Fear certainly has the songs and contemporary sheen to make Sia a star in her own right, but its at the expense of both her emotional intimacy and her offbeat personality.","Mar 31, 2015"

Pitchfork,85,"A startling and inspiring record. Enos been involved with quite a few of those in the past, but its especially nice to experience a new one that reaches us in the present moment.","Mar 31, 2015"
The Quietus,84,"The six-track album (seven if you buy the digital, eight if you pony up for the vinyl edition coming out in August) has the internal warmth and jubilant spirit that its predecessor was lacking, with the music appearing to blossom before you rather than clacking by like a train.","Mar 31, 2015"
Exclaim,80,"By dispensing with typical pop structure in favour of improvisation and repetition, the pair achieve and maintain an openness and momentum that Someday World lacked. It feels alive.","Mar 31, 2015"
Fact Magazine (UK),75,"The team weaves electronic tones, human voice and hypnotic rhythms to create a beefy work designed for maximum volume.","Mar 31, 2015"

XLR8r,70,"Unlike Someday World, the far thornier High Life doesnt improve much with repeated plays: These are egghead jams whose esoteric textures bewitch more than their relatively static frameworks.","Mar 31, 2015"
Uncut,70,"The constant repetition with more or less subtle shades of developing dynamic and texture in all but the last of these tracks creates a nearly endless groove. And perhaps that's the album's point, creating an album of dance music that's fun to listen to; a mirror image of Someday World's more carefully structured avant pop.","Mar 31, 2015"
Pitchfork,67,"Uniquely imaginative, the duo's efforts will seduce like-minded forward-thinkers, but High Life will be too ostensibly weird to be widely digested.","Mar 31, 2015"
Resident Advisor,60,"High Life doesnt suffer from any real clunkers and is more consistently sonically rewarding, so that makes it the better album. And thats what ultimately makes it the more frustrating of the two; even the more successful collection put together by Eno and Hyde is mostly just further proof that they havent yet made the album together that theyre clearly capable of.","Mar 31, 2015"
XLR8r,60,"The duo's experience and aplomb win out. [Sep 2014, p.108]","Mar 31, 2015"

Exclaim,60,"It does occasionally miss the mark, but that there are any hits to speak of at all shows that Eno and Hyde have a good deal more to offer than the uninspiring gruel of their debut.","Mar 31, 2015"
Resident Advisor,60,"Its not quite as appealing generally speaking, but does feature music for those moments when a soundtrack to a subtle atmosphere is needed-- whether on screen or in imaginations--with hints of more life slipping in between.","Mar 31, 2015"
Q Magazine,60,"You'd rather hope their systems/world music jams might be more wiggy than they are. Still, this second helping is a match for its predecessor.","Mar 31, 2015"
AllMusic,55,"As is stands, High Life has the sound of a half-finished addendum to a half-finished idea.","Mar 31, 2015"
Billboard.com,40,"There are things going on here that will, in all likelihood, percolate through to stadium pop in due course but Hyde lacks the vocal presence or structural songcraft to shape the material into something greater than its parts.","Mar 31, 2015"
The Telegraph (UK),25,"You can applaud them for chasing a creative high, but from two artists of their caliber, listeners should expect something better than High Life.","Mar 31, 2015"

The Observer (UK),80,"In moving beyond their avant-garde origins, the 'technopop' which comprises the latter half of this compilation has often been viewed as a descent into the lightweight, and a commercial sell-out. On the contrary, #7885 (Electropunk to Technopop 1978 - 1985) proves a mastery of superficially conflicting musical spaces.","Mar 24, 2015"
Slant Magazine,78,"As an entry point into two of the distinct faces of Cabaret Voltaire, #7885 is an undeniably valuable document, and one thats as much about the importance of growth and change as it is about the birth of a sound.","Mar 24, 2015"
The A.V. Club,70,"This is a great entry point into the catalogue of one of Britains most inventive, iconic bands--but the shallowness of the record makes it largely unnecessary for anyone that owns the Original Sound compilations, or indeed the albums themselves.","Mar 24, 2015"
Exclaim,70,"Unfortunately, however, no matter how listenable the latter half of this compilation is, its hard not to feel that its a shame Cabaret Voltaire abandoned their early abrasiveness as quickly as they did.","Mar 24, 2015"
Resident Advisor,70,"It goes without saying that this is a must have collection that will educate, entertain, and most importantly, remind us of Cabaret Voltaire's lasting influence and cement it in an approachable collection for further generations to delve into.","Mar 24, 2015"

RapReviews.com,70,"Some will find the albums often starry-eyed nature vaguely overdone, and its this more than anything else that will turn them off. However, for those who fall weak at the knees when the strains of R&B, soul, and hip-hop hit their ears, even in an idiosyncratically distorted form, the post-millennial quotations and evolutions of In My World will be love at first listen.","Mar 24, 2015"
Paste Magazine,60,"In My World is an argument that the drugs are getting better, and maybe even too good, but it proves that freaky hallucinations are hard to string together, and that the impish can be irksome when clever is pushed to its limit.","Mar 24, 2015"
PopMatters,54,"Even at its best, though, In My World resembles a less-engaging version of someone else, the sound of an artist regressing instead of stepping forward into new territory.","Mar 24, 2015"
Blurt Magazine,50,"The whole album sounds like it was mastered from a chewed-up old C90--it's post-chillwave music, busy and glitchy, but as relaxing as a soak in a warm bath.","Mar 24, 2015"
Tiny Mix Tapes,50,"In My World is a counterpoint to McQueens recent work: while the introduction of vocals reveals another side to Matthewdavid, the humour--too often overplayed--is its weakness element.","Mar 24, 2015"
The New York Times,40,"Matthewdavid is forever littering these tracks with too many disparate ideas and sometimes you find yourself wishing he'd taken more lessons from his previous LP and realised that less is more.","Mar 24, 2015"

AllMusic,90,"Sprawling, ambitious and mostly well-executed, While (1<2) may confuse his fan bases Ultra-attending electro house contingent, but deadmau5s double album undoubtedly marks his most mature and forward-thinking release to date.","Mar 24, 2015"

Rolling Stone,60,"Ultimately, while(1<2) is overlong and never quite the cohesive masterpiece it wants to be, but there's tantalising evidence of a smart brain ticking away beneath those big Disney ears. [Aug 2014, p.114]","Mar 24, 2015"
NOW Magazine,40,"Repeating very simple, barely there melodies over spare arrangements and ghostly keys is fine when you're soundtracking a Michael Mann film, but it isn't enough to fill the long gaps between your club-crashers.","Mar 24, 2015"
XLR8r,40,"For his seventh album, Deadmau5 has turned from an electro-house polymath into the world's most unnecessary Nine Inch Nails tribute act.... However, erase the Reznor fan fiction from this 141-minute behemoth, and there's a solid 64-minute house record hidden in there.","Mar 24, 2015"

AllMusic,80,"Theres a communal ambience on show here; using three vocalists gives it a mixtape aesthetic, the music feeling like a bulging bag of pick and mix.","Mar 23, 2015"
Clash Music,70,"When GusGus joined Kompakt, the association seemed odd--almost charitable on the label's part--but now it makes total sense.","Mar 23, 2015"

Resident Advisor,60,"The rest of the album has its moments, though mainly it seems like a chance for the GusGus gang to showcase what other electrified trickery they can muster.","Mar 23, 2015"
Pitchfork,60,"The album experiments and draws on a number of electronic genres to bring together something that is at times mesmerising, even if it doesnt always hold perfectly.","Mar 23, 2015"
PopMatters,60,"GusGus, Icelandic veterans of artsy techno music, have always enjoyed provoking their audience, and when they do so here, it's exhilarating.... but sadly GusGus can't keep it up.","Mar 23, 2015"

Tiny Mix Tapes,76,"The headspace it produces is calming but frequently, dreamily surreal, and it often seems like a better place to live than the world outside it.","Mar 17, 2015"
AllMusic,70,"The result of hearing Ishi in full is a desolate, somewhat submerged feeling, with both the sounds of space travel and the light years of loneliness and isolation coming through in the album's many layers of gentle noise and spiraling synth leads.","Mar 17, 2015"
Exclaim,70,"Peaceful yet highly engaging, Ishi invokes the masters of modular synthesis, a music rooted in technology that somehow comes across as utterly primeval.","Mar 17, 2015"

Tiny Mix Tapes,60,"Sometimes great, often fun, but mostly quite confused, its not a focused LP--though its certainly an expression of the oddness of 2014.","Mar  3, 2015"
Q Magazine,50,"It's not all bad, and sometimes the reverse is true, with the strings the best thing about the track; the opening figure from 'A+E' is very pretty and the violin rising up in 'Cologne' is melodious and elegant, but they both give way to more of the electro-flotsam.","Mar  3, 2015"

The Wire,80,"It's possible to detect elements of jazz, '70s soul, hip-hop and electronica in McFerrin's heliocentric mix, but through his intentional blurring of the boundaries, he underlines his mastery of and ultimate disregard for genre categories.","Feb 16, 2015"

DIY Magazine,80,"Sure, the sound of Shriek may scare off people who need guitars to be the focal point of their indie rock, but for anyone with a slightly more experimental nature or anyone who likes synths and subtlety and wonderfully emotive vocals, it's a great and welcome surprise that's a brilliant step forward for Wye Oak.","Nov 25, 2014"

The Quietus,75,"Tremors manages the feat of being both invigorating and mellow, and no matter how many layers of sound in which the songs find themselves wrapped up, electronic or otherwise, they remain painstakingly personal and human.","Nov 11, 2014"
AllMusic,70,"Sohn casts his falsetto in blues-worthy scenarios--a one-man band balancing songcraft and heady post-dubstep production better than James Blake or Rhye, two inevitable comparisons.","Nov 11, 2014"

Consequence of Sound,90,"Given the ubiquity of some of this material, It's Album Time is a little tricky to assess on its own merit. But with tracks like 'Delorean Dynamite,' 'Johnny And Mary,' and 'Old Joy,' there are certainly plenty of grandiose stretches to keep us satisfied.","Nov 11, 2014"
Uncut,90,"Its a broad net Terje casts here, flitting through myriad styles but he always ensures theyre congealed in order to give the record a cohesiveness and rigidity.","Nov 11, 2014"
XLR8r,90,"Adventurous but not selfish, intelligent but not difficult, a victory lap of sorts but hardly congratulatory, Terje's first album is astoundingly balanced and astonishingly broad, a wider serving of the man's artistic vision that ultimately proves just as satisfying as his single servings have in the past.","Nov 11, 2014"
Fact Magazine (UK),90,"Its not just Album Time, its crazy psychedelic hoo-ha time, and it sounds pretty damn fine.","Nov 11, 2014"
The Wire,88,"Terjes cocky, frisky songwriting skills shine, and Its Album Time easily clears the high bar the producer set for himself through his remixes and EPs.","Nov 11, 2014"
Resident Advisor,87,"For as much ground as he covers on It's Album Time, the music feels effortless, gliding from Henry Mancini-esque detective jazz to bouncy, Stevie Wonder funk like breeze blowing through the waffle weave of a leisure suit. Conventional wisdom bears out: The looser the grip, the tighter the hold.","Nov 11, 2014"

The Guardian,80,"His propensity for pushing boundaries is carried over onto an album that devotes more than a third of its runtime to previously released songs. Terje took the remainder of that time and expended it on bold, successful new iterations of his aesthetic.","Nov 11, 2014"
The Line of Best Fit,80,"The Instagram of albums, which is to say a source of instant nostalgia, its 70s- and 80s-inspired cocktail of disco, house, lounge, samba et al, could be merely kitsch but is elevated both by the meticulousness of its production and the sinuous seductiveness of its melodies.","Nov 11, 2014"

Clash Music,80,"Terje can make an aging gigolo's commentary on the folly of his misspent youth the centerpiece of his otherwise invigorating dance album because he's the rare crowd-pleasing DJ whose musical skills trump his proven ability to move butts.","Nov 11, 2014"
PopMatters,80,"His debut may have taken a decade to gestate, but well probably still be unpacking its innovative grooves in another.","Nov 11, 2014"

Q Magazine,80,"It's Album Time is structured similarly, slowly building an argument that there's genuine talent behind the sheen of novelty, only to have Terje zigzag in the other direction, dodging the argument he would claim he wasn't even interested in making in the first place.","Nov 11, 2014"

Under The Radar,60,"There's certainly nothing wrong with a producer as talented as Terje feeling constrained by the style of music that's made him famous and wanting to spread his wings. It's just that the areas that Terje spreads his wings into feel a bit hackneyed.","Nov 11, 2014"
CMJ,50,"Its Album Time is a great casual listen, but its obvious from its highlights that Terje is capable of even greater highs.","Nov 11, 2014"

Resident Advisor,70,"This album was crafted amid relative calm, and this peacefulness is present in every track.","Nov 11, 2014"
Uncut,67,"E S T A R A is almost hypnotic in its tendency to make each individual track blur itself into an indistinct piece of a loosely memorable whole, one with little impression actually retained even if it jumps from mood to mood.","Nov 11, 2014"

Q Magazine,70,"Inventions sets aside such linear development; instead, in a track like Flood Poems, the background looms up and submerges the guitar and percussion. Still, the album does head somewhere; marches emerge as the beat strengthens in the albums closing tracks.","Nov  4, 2014"

Spin,70,"While the pedigree of this project is certainly strong, Inventions stands strong on its own, so although fans of Eluvium and Explosions in the Sky won't have any trouble digging into the album, being a fan of the duo's previous work isn't a part of the price of admission.","Nov  4, 2014"

The 405,65,"Theres a sense of exhaustion in Spectre, but its not an exhaustion with irony and a refuge in po-faced sloganeering.

American Songwriter,60,"For their DJ-Kicks mix, Brand Brauer Frick continues the trios pursuit of the human element, which is often lacking in electronic music and digitally assembled computer mixes, by recording their entire set live on vinyl during a daytime session at the Berlin club Watergate.

Paste Magazine,89,"Its Jones powerful, perfectly vibrato-laden voice that creates just the right of emotion for every break-up, hook-up, fed up and uplifting track on the barely 30-minute record.","Jul  1, 2014"
NOW Magazine,85,"The best album of their career thus far.","Jul  1, 2014"
DIY Magazine,83,"Give The People What They Want certainly lives up to its name, but its no rehash of the past--or a collection that panders.","Jul  1, 2014"
The Guardian,80,"The now-well-established ensemble pulls off a notable twofer with Give the People What They Want. Its made a full-length album that hangs together as a distinct whole, and its also written a collection of unique songs that stands tall as an example of what still makes the genre vital.","Jul  1, 2014"
Consequence of Sound,80,"This pan-generational Jones/Dap-Kings team have been injecting new vitality into a classic form since 2002, and the people will certainly want their strong new soul album. [Feb 2014, p.90]","Jul  1, 2014"
Q Magazine,80,"Its a triumphant comeback.","Jul  1, 2014"
The 405,80,"Feeling as genuine, exiting, and downright fun as their very best work, it does just as the title suggests--with the band back on blistering form and Jones solidifying her place in the pantheon of soul legends.","Jul  1, 2014"
Resident Advisor,80,"The Dap-Kings prove once again to be an almost mind-bogglingly crisp backing band, with tickingly taught percussion, sticky bass lines and sweat-inducing brass. But its Jones, of course, who holds together every song with her now-classic vox.","Jul  1, 2014"
Magnet,80,"Jones and company sound at the top of their game.","Jul  1, 2014"
Fact Magazine (UK),80,"If you are seeking something original then this is not it; if you are a fan of good music and your ears need their medicine, this is exactly what the doctor ordered.","Jul  1, 2014"
Clash Music,80,"Theres nary a moment missed by the band to demonstrate that Sharon Jones is one of the greatest female vocalist currently operating.","Jul  1, 2014"
Pitchfork,80,"These ten songs sound almost designed to be played on repeat, and keep with the always colorful and ecstatically fun sound audiences have come to expect from one of the best acts going in retrofitted classic soul.","Jul  1, 2014"
The Quietus,80,"Although it perhaps lacks the wasted acrobatics and distracting volume that populates todays popscape, Give The People What They Want nevertheless reminds us that its both range and heart that helps compelling soul music survive both a century of cynics and existential close calls.","Jul  1, 2014"
The New York Times,80,"Give The People What They Want is an especially bright new feather in the cap. Its towering, tempestuous, addictive, and available in a beautiful shade of marbled blue. Maybe we dont deserve it, but its here to own us just the same.","Jul  1, 2014"
AllMusic,80,"[Jones'] natural ebullience still drives the splendid Give the People What They Want, a hook-laden affair keeping up the high standard set by I Learned the Hard Way and 2011s punchy Soul Time!, as good an R&B album as any in recent years.","Jul  1, 2014"
Drowned In Sound,80,"A great album full of songs both uplifting and danceable, emotional and cerebral.","Jul  1, 2014"
Exclaim,80,"No matter how contrived the sound, however, there's no writing this troupe off as lazy pastiche.... Give the People What They Want breathes passionate new life into the past.","Jul  1, 2014"
Uncut,80,"It the bits between the notes that rescue this from the status of pointless fidelity and make it so compelling. [Sep 2013, p.90]","Jul  1, 2014"
AllMusic,80,"Their fifth album together since 2002 maintains an astonishing standard comparable even to that of original legends like Aretha Franklin and Otis Redding. [Jan 2014, p.122]","Jul  1, 2014"
Exclaim,80,"The 50-something from Brooklyn is her own diva and sounds at once wounded, defiant and exuberant. Producer-bassist Bosco Mann runs a tight band with its own tricks and which purrs along so joyously the influences fade to leave a core of unadulterated soul.","Jul  1, 2014"
Mojo,77,"Give the People What They Want is a pretty short 10 songs, though its breezy half-hour leaves plenty that sticks and plenty more worth revisiting when it doesn't.","Jul  1, 2014"
The Wire,75,"Their sixth disc nails the familiar pleasure centers, but truly excites only when the singer casts manners aside. [24 Jan 2014, p.67]","Jul  1, 2014"
PopMatters,70,"A dozen years in, her brass-powered group is both extending and preserving tradition; it remains a national treasure and an instant soul party.","Jul  1, 2014"
The Quietus,70,"Despite the Dap Kings versatility--they were more hushed and drowsier backing Charles Bradley on last year's Victim of Love--and Jones' indefatigability, there aren't many new ideas here. That's not the point, though. The point is that music from another time can still thrill us in this one because of its practically tyrannical insistence on bliss.","Jul  1, 2014"
Fact Magazine (UK),70,"Whereas I Learned the Hard Way suffered from a lack of variation in songwriting, Give the People What They Want transverses the dictionary of soul and pulls out a few different entries, making it a much more engaging record.","Jul  1, 2014"
Tiny Mix Tapes,70,"Rarely has reliability been this funky.","Jul  1, 2014"
Pitchfork,70,"Give the People What They Want is a collection of songs that not only sees the Dap-Kings reveling in a variety of musical tones, from confident, strutting anthems of independence to slow-burning, intimate ballads, but also displays Jones at her most vocally ferocious, lending a self-assured voice to the down and out.","Jul  1, 2014"
Sputnikmusic,70,"Although Sharon Jones & the Dap-Kings are brilliant Motown/Stax revivalists, their stalwart '60s soul/funk, at times, hits the inevitable yawn note.","Jul  1, 2014"
The Line of Best Fit,60,"Never a subtle singer, Jones attacks her soul anthems like a blunt force instrument. Thats fine, since nuance isnt called for here. Force is, and Jones has enough of it to thrill. That still isnt enough to drag the Dap-Kings out of the shadows of their idols.","Jul  1, 2014"
The 405,60,"As much as Give the People What They Want is a quasi-holding pattern and is middling in its success, hope that she can get back to doing what she does best, which just so happens to be the title of this very album.","Jul  1, 2014"
Q Magazine,60,"The album is missing an emotional, drawn-out, heartbreaking ballad, but inspirational anthems like Retreat! find her sassing as loud and proud as ever.","Jul  1, 2014"

musicOMH.com,90,"Total Strife Forever is a brutal electronic album, but one that still retains a very humanistic core--this juxtaposition is a thematic thread which runs throughout the album. Doyle then sculpts and defines the music in order to create tension between these two disparate elements, or else uses their differences in order to surprise and engage the listener.","Jul  1, 2014"
The Wire,90,"A Major new British talent is born in William Doyle's solo debut, which sounds like the great lost album that Brian Wilson, Eno and Bjork should have made together. [Feb 2014, p.75]","Jul  1, 2014"
Drowned In Sound,90,"Total Strife Forever is breathtaking. It might get tough sometimes, lonely and desolate even, but Doyles catharsis will hoist you by the bootstraps into lusher pastures.","Jul  1, 2014"
Resident Advisor,90,"While James Blake came good on his Mercury prize winning second album, William Doyle as East India Youth has delivered a stunningly exquisite work on his very first go.","Jul  1, 2014"
Exclaim,90,"This is music thats meticulous and expansive without ever falling into the trap of being boring or self-indulgent.","Jul  1, 2014"
Pitchfork,90,"Total Strife Forever is that scarcest of things; a masterly record which walks a unpredictable line musically yet remains entirely consistent in quality.","Jul  1, 2014"
Q Magazine,85,"It's a rare album in this genre that blends relaxation with excitement so perfectly, that stays cool without ever being aloof or dragging.","Jul  1, 2014"
musicOMH.com,80,"When it swells and soars, it doesn't just work. It werks. [Feb 2014, p.115]","Jul  1, 2014"
Fact Magazine (UK),80,"Locating a broken, but still-beating heart within metallic machine music, East India Youth's debut is a triumph. [Feb 2014, p.97]","Jul  1, 2014"
New Musical Express (NME),80,"Its well executed, quite odd, highly original and full of promise--exactly what you want from a debut album.","Jul  1, 2014"
The Line of Best Fit,80,"An often fairly classicist pop record which nods heavily towards naggingly familiar influences, yet doesn't feel like it could exist at any other time than now.","Jul  1, 2014"
AllMusic,80,"Perhaps surprisingly, Doyle is at his most affecting when he's vocal-free.","Jul  1, 2014"
NOW Magazine,80,"What really sets Total Strife Forever apart is Doyles vocal ability.","Jul  1, 2014"
DIY Magazine,80,"Innovative, cerebral and yet totally accessible, Total Strife Forever is an incredibly impressive record.","Jul  1, 2014"
The 405,70,"While William Doyles career is undoubtedly on an upward trajectory and I am looking forward to his evolution as an artist, Total Strife Forever is hardly a landmark in electronic music.","Jul  1, 2014"
The A.V. Club,70,"In terms of compositional sophistication, Doyle struggles to compete with the Jon Hopkinses of this world, his emotional brushstrokes unambiguous and delineated. But considering hes a 22 year old home producer, comparing Total Strife Forever to last years EP shows that hes growing exponentially.","Jul  1, 2014"
Pitchfork,70,"Although Doyle's vocal melodies lack focus at times, Total Strife Forever possesses enough left-turns to satisfy the most adventurous electronic music fans.","Jul  1, 2014"
Filter,70,"Total Strife Forever (thanks, Foals) is an ambitious, absorbing debut, and still probably only a glimpse of what East India Youths capable of.","Jul  1, 2014"
New Musical Express (NME),60,"The jumps between genres barely jar once you realise how good Doyle is at all of them.","Jul  1, 2014"
Uncut,40,"While Doyle struggles to balance his various musical elements--the opening 10 minutes is sheer drudgery--he has a nice way with layered vocal harmonies, which deserve more regular exposure.","Jul  1, 2014"
