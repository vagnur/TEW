I think 'Drugs or Jesus' is a great title but a missed opportunity, the song doesn't live up to its name. Less is more, my opinion, and very few albums can stand to be longer than 40 minutes or so. Losing half a dozen of these tracks would have lifted the overall quality. As for his voice, it's okay, but does sound over-processed in places (too much of the Exciter). The band are great, and it's unusual for an artist to record with his road band, so well done for that.",0,0,"Dec 14, 2004"

Don't get me wrong: Loretta deserves the lion's share of the credit, for her brilliant songwriting, the range of emotion she expresses, and her amazing voice (I'd be lucky to have half her pipes at half her age). Some of these songs, like the title track, are good enough to give me shivers.

Every other song is wonderful, often in low-key ways. The finale 'Story of My Life' might sum up where this album fits into her own discography (only hope she has some more classics in her.)

Yet she never mentions the in-your-face advertising from corporations, the credit card companies who hand out cards to anyone, loan/check cashing companies, etc. That would be too bold of a statement. I hate it when someone like Shania (who will never want for anything in her lifetime) sits on her throne and chastises others on how they manage their money. Let me ask you this, Shania - how many people do you think bought your overlong, bland CD with near-the-limit credit cards? Or used it to purchase your concert tickets and merchandise? You wrote the wrong lyrics, babe, and you need to realize that you and your record company are part of the problem. Normally, just because of this song I would rate this CD a '0.'

10,"I'm 40. The 70's raw reckless experimentalism is dead. The wonderful 80's started a new path of sound but was ultimately killed by its record companies and resultant overkill redundancies. The ninieties stood as 10 long years of everything-you've-heard-before-rehashed and a decade of music that will be forgotten forever. This decade will be known as the one true decade of musical fusion. To wit: You get these really old crazy bastards who did their own thing year in and year out, regardless if they were fat or starving depending on the market. They just didn't care. They just wanted the hard career road of doing what they pleased. The ultimate F-You. Neil Young, Bob Dylan, and especially Lou Reed..but before you can count out the 4th commercial-free iconoclast, here comes Johnny Cash. He dropped off the radar before Rick Rubin groveled at him in '93. We are all lucky Rubin did. Who would of thought that Rubin's proposition to Cash would change everything? 'I want to sign you to my label. You can sing anything you want, just you and your guitar.' Good, God. And you are the luckiest man in the universe to have a monster like Cash look at you and say, 'OK.' American IV is a knowing swan song. Is every song about The End? Yes. He knew it. He burned a decade with Rubin showing he was the badass of badasses, but with IV, he sang it like it was his last. He said so in the liner notes. People will go on and on about the devastating version of a the devastating NIN song 'Hurt,' but for me the THINGS I KEEP COMING BACK TO ARE: Sting's straightforward 'I Hung My Head,' Cash's 'The Man Comes Around,' Cash' 'Sam Hall, the Eagle's 'Desperado', and the beautiful treatment of tear-jerker 'The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face.' I grew up with a dad and mom who loved Elvis, Neil Diamond, Waylon, Willie, and Johnny Cash. I did not get reintroduced 'til 'Delia's Gone.' in '93. I used to laugh uncomfortably when my uncle---a die hard Johnny fan--would say 'a Dylan song? You're full of shit, Brent. That's a Johnny song.' Now I understand.",0,0,"Feb 26, 2006"

9,"Johnny Cashes 'American' project is a good test of the concept 'Is it the song or the singer?'. The argument being if a song is a classic, it's very hard to mess it up. Cash can never be accused of messing up the songs he covers here and as I said about American III, it could be argued he brings the sheer quality of some of these songs into sharp focus with stripped down versions, with all studio trickery and effects stripped away, often all your left with are the lyrics and the chords. American IV is my personal favourite of the series with almost every track warranting it's place on the record. The inclusion of 'Hurt' and 'I Hung My Head' give the record an extra dose of class but this really works as an overall album. Probably the best country album I've heard.",0,0,"Jul 27, 2012"

Good to see her expand her horizons beyond 'pure country', because her talent is so much bigger than one genre or another.

Never mind the style of the song, I do miss steel guitar and fiddle, banjo, mandolin. I don't care for Dolly or Emmylou, but I like the texture of country instruments, so it's a shame she's abandoned them.

It didn't work for him, and it probably won't sell a lot of records, but what a great album. Go buy this one. I did, even though I had already downloaded it from the newsgroups.

My favorites are 'Not For Me' and 'Hello, God', and especially 'Raven Dove', one of the better peacenik songs I've heard in some time.

9,"An inspired, warm, incredibly accessible album, Parton's voice has actually improved with the texture of age. This album ranks among Dolly's best. Her cover of 'If' gives new credence to seeking out and re-working old gems, and even gospel-hued numbers like 'John Daniel' will have you tapping your foot. With this album ending a trio of blugrass inspired music ventures, Parton has assured her place in music's pantheon as the quintissential American musical artist: blissfully contradictory, unabashedly sentimental, and herculean in her strength of lyrical prose.",0,0,"Sep  5, 2002"
10,"I must say this album blew me away. I listened to the first track 'Halos and Horns' and had to play it again. I did that on every song, and thought I'm never going to get to the end of this album cause it's all so good. I think I played 'Hello God' three times. When I finally finished the cd I was amazed at it's depth. It made me laugh on 'These Old Bones' and 'I'm Gone'. I nearly cried on 'Hello God' and 'Not for Me'. I got chills on 'Raven Dove' and 'Stairway to Heaven,' which is a standout as 'Shine' was on the awesome Little Sparrow released last year. If this project doesn't award her another grammy I will be shocked. Halos and Horns incorporates the splendor of Hungry Again, Heartsongs, The Grass is Blue and Little Sparrow all into one disc. Dolly's vocals are breathtaking as she soars over the bluegrass, gospel and traditional country numbers with ease. 'Dagger Through the Heart' is Dolly at her vocal best. This disc far surpasses Oh Brother Where Art Thou and also tops her last two masterpieces. I've listed to this cd so much in the last six days, and I love it even more now.

In fact it could be argued he brings the quality some of these songs into sharp focus with stripped down versions, with all studio trickery and effects stripped away, often all your left with are the lyrics and the chords. Although I prefer American IV,  American III is quite good overall. There are a few questionable inclusions here but the high points on this record are in my view, up with the high points of his career.
