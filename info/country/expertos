,80,"While her introspection and understated approach bog things down at times, songs like 'The Dreaming Road' and 'King of Love' are finely crafted and often hauntingly beautiful.","Feb 10, 2015"
,75,"Carpenter delivers a batch of reassuring songs -- about confidence in yourself and the world -- making you wish she'd check in a bit more often.","Feb 10, 2015"
,70,"She's always straddled musical genres, and Time*Sex*Love boasts a clear pop streak, with the influence of the Beach Boys evident on the harmonies of 'Maybe World' and the string arrangements on 'What Was It Like' and 'King of Love.'","Feb 10, 2015"
,67,"Stick with her slow, depressing stuff, and bring your Zoloft. [6/1/2001, p.90]","Feb 10, 2015"

,100,"In wedding bluegrass with the Appalachian sound of her youth, Parton, who wrote half of the material and reprises her classic ''Down From Dover,'' repeatedly explores her favorite theme -- romantic betrayal -- and turns in a powerful performance, augmented by the best of bluegrass' hot pickers","Feb 10, 2015"
,90,"Dolly Parton has at last returned to her musical home and, boy, are the neighbors ever grateful. That 'home,' of course, is Kentucky bluegrass music and the melancholy acoustic strains of the Appalachian Mountains.","Feb 10, 2015"
,90,"Little Sparrow contains some of the most beautiful and affecting music Parton has ever made...","Feb 10, 2015"
,80,"Little Sparrow mixes its trad tendencies with tunes, lovely instruments, and best of all, Parton's personality.","Feb 10, 2015"
,80,"Her taste in cover material is slightly idiosyncratic, but that does nothing but add luster to the program...","Feb 10, 2015"
,80,"Surrounding herself with the cream of Southern bluegrass musicians -- dobro master Jerry Douglas and guitar prodigy Bryan Sutton among them -- Parton is by turns reflective ('Little Sparrow'), playful ('Marry Me'), dolorous ('My Blue Tears'), spirited ('I Don't Believe You've Met My Baby') and spiritual ('In the Sweet By and By') on this nearly hour-long modern-bluegrass tour de force.","Feb 10, 2015"
,80,"Little Sparrow captures one of country's greatest talents in top form, backed by some of the best acoustic players around...","Feb 10, 2015"
,77,"Joined by a bevy of bluegrass talent, including Jerry Douglas, Chris Thile, and Alison Krauss, Little Sparrow is a richly wrought, beautifully performed labor of love for Parton.","Feb 10, 2015"
,70,"This of course is the power of mountain music, the weight it gives to simple instruments and simple folk, and for all of Parton's talents, singing in this medium may very well be her best.","Feb 10, 2015"
,70,"Little Sparrow proves that 1999's The Grass Is Green was no fleeting burst of inspiration; Parton hasn't been so consistently exciting since the '70s.","Feb 10, 2015"

,80,"A sizeable chunk of the album contains what is by far some of the best material this group has done in ages.","Feb 10, 2015"
,40,"In making consistently mediocre music, the group appeals to the country fan with the lowest expectations out of life, one who never wants his moon-pie-and-RC-Cola values challenged, but likes his emotions jostled once in a while.","Feb 10, 2015"
,40,"While the album is a distinct improvement on 1999's Twentieth Century, it still fails to rise above the level of a few good songs padded by a whole lot of filler.","Feb 10, 2015"
,20,"Problem is, Alabama's pop panache, which made it at least a guilty pleasure for much of the '80s, seems to have been replaced by an impulse toward pure schmaltz.","Feb 10, 2015"

,90,"The playing is terrific throughout... [Jan 2001, p.98]","Jan 27, 2015"
,80,"'Sounds' sounds great, alternating between driving, percussive romps like 'Love Caught Up To Me,' 'Free To Go,' and 'Dreams Of Clay' and moments of sheer country perfection in 'Time Spent Missing You,' 'A Promise You Can't Keep,' and the wonderfully hangdog Hank Williams knockoff 'The Heartaches Are Free.'","Jan 27, 2015"
,80,"Even though there's little stylistic maturation in his approach since his first release in 1986, Yoakam's songwriting craft keeps improving, and any track from this album could be a hit single. With Tomorrow's Sounds Today, Dwight Yoakam has fashioned a contemporary roots-conscious country album whose qualities, like the artist's distinctive style, are timeless.","Jan 27, 2015"
,80,"Twangy guitars, melancholy pedal steel and mournful, high country fiddles abound on this collection... Tomorrow's Sounds Today forgoes the livelier and more genre-bending studio tricks that pushed mid-'90s albums such as Gone and This Time into brave new sonic realms. This time around, as it was in the beginning, the mood is modest, the sound is sparse and sans embellishments.","Jan 27, 2015"
,70,"Tomorrow's Sounds Today lacks the focused punch of Yoakam's best album, 1995's lean-and-mean Gone, but it's at least as consistent as his recent Nineties greatest-hits set -- right down to the nifty honky-tonk rock & roll cover, 'I Want You to Want Me.'","Jan 27, 2015"
,62,"Tomorrow's Sounds Today belies its promising title by breaking no new ground, and, in fact, retracing some pretty well-known boot-scootin' steps.... If nothing else, it's still a pleasure to hear on Tomorrow's Sounds Today what producer and guitarist extraordinaire Pete Anderson can do with material that is only average.","Jan 27, 2015"
,60,"Tomorrow's Sounds Today returns to a more conventional approach, with 14 full-band songs replete with strings, slides, and electric guitars. As is frequently the case, however, more is less, with Yoakam settling for modestly ambling charmers in lieu of transcendent moments.","Jan 27, 2015"
,58,"Tomorrow's sound, grittier and dustier than '98's poppish A Long Way Home, masks the album's core blandness; too much of the material is just plain forgettable. [11/3/2000, p.83]","Jan 27, 2015"

,100,"Though the Man in Black has rarely sounded blacker, producer Rick Rubin frames that deep sea voice with harmonies and churchly organs, making for a dark angel beauty of an album that's austere but welcoming.","Jan 27, 2015"
,100,"When a tune falls into the jurisdiction of the venerable country-folk troubadour, the accumulated details of any previous readings or associations are stripped away, and its core brilliantly revealed.","Jan 27, 2015"
,90,"'Solitary Man' may lack the immediate impact of its predecessors but is no less a masterpiece.","Jan 27, 2015"
,90,"Greying at the edges, its tremor more pronounced, his voice is sober, honest, defiant. And it turns rock songs into something that sounds as old as the hills.","Jan 27, 2015"
,90,"Though the covers on American III will attract the majority of listener attention, Cashs own material steals the show.","Jan 27, 2015"
,86,"While some critics take issue with Rubin's underproduction, none of the songs on American III require ornate instrumentation. Whether they've been fluffed up or stripped raw, at the core of each is a compelling statement from one of our greatest humanists.","Jan 27, 2015"
,80,"So at 68 he's still able to churn out songs that are immediately likable, if not instantly classic. For a man who's seemingly suffered from every ailment imaginable in the past few years, his signature baritone remains as strong and expressive as ever, too.","Jan 27, 2015"
,80,"All in all, as resonant and dignified a covers album as you'll ever hear.","Jan 27, 2015"
,78,"If one wanted to quibble, one could say that the Cash-Rubin collaboration is starting to feel just a little formulaic.... yet Cash continually surprises with his ability to completely inhabit material by writers much younger than him.","Jan 27, 2015"
,70,"Mostly downbeat, the album feels, at times, as if it were created beneath a black cloud.","Jan 27, 2015"
,60,"The onus here lies on the production... Rick Rubin's work is too timid; mostly, the shy combos of guitar, fiddle and accordion, or Benmont Tench's subliminal contributions on keyboards, make up the kind of severe meal that one is forced to think of as 'tasteful.'","Jan 27, 2015"
,60,"Like Neil Young's Silver And Gold, it feels like a thematically empty, knockabout place-holder. American Recordings, one of Cash's towering classics, was all devotion and doubt, a brilliant, raw-boned meditation on redemption and death. A loose, flat set of odds and ends, Solitary Man is merely a minor but endearing record from a man who seems to know he's given more than enough.","Jan 27, 2015"
,60,"The results on 'Solitary Man' are mixed, leaning at times to inadvertent novelty.","Jan 27, 2015"
,60,"I'm assuming the problems began when Rubin presented Cash with a cache of songs to choose from. From there, Rubin's production only makes a bad situation worse, putting Cash's dusty, reverbless voice -- which is beginning to show its frailties -- unnaturally in your face.... But if you can wade through the chaff, it's Cash's originals that save the disc.","Jan 27, 2015"
,60,"Like his two previous studio albums, Solitary Man is sparsely produced by Rick Rubin, and continues the themes of love, faith, and loneliness that their previous collaborations have chillingly embraced.","Jan 27, 2015"

,87,"The surprise is how extraordinarily well it all fits together, songs and guest vocalists pulled from all over the landscape, all blues and all inescapably Willie.","Jan 20, 2015"
,70,"Fortunately, for most of the album, the soft-but-solid Austin backing band assembled by guitarist/co-producer Derek O'Brien is as well seasoned as Nelson, and shares his gift for making a little go a long way. And, ultimately, the best tracks may well be those sung by Willie alone.","Jan 20, 2015"
,70,"It plays like an enjoyable variety show, since, as opposed to star turns, Willie's company puts in guest appearances, creating a strange mixture of not enough or a little too much (save for Willie's solo turns).","Jan 20, 2015"
,70,"Nelson makes his competition sound like thin parodies... he burns the melody down to ashes, never letting a howl do what a moan can do better. [Nov. 2000, p.208]","Jan 20, 2015"
,70,"Like everything else he plays, Nelson's blues are unforced and natural.... The result is emotionally rich, musically savory and languidly blue from end to end.","Jan 20, 2015"
,70,"If there is one drawback to this album, it is its somewhat overproduced nature. A little too clean and a little too short, Milk Cow Blues shows glimpses of what could have been, an all-star cast jamming to Willie classics and traditional blues like 'The Thrill Is Gone' and 'Ain't Nobody's Business.'","Jan 20, 2015"
,60,"A sterling showcase for Nelson's bluesier side ?","Jan 20, 2015"
,50,"The duets always seem like an intrusion to his musical vision, especially since everybody except Dr. John oversells these songs, singing like a clich instead of finding their own sound. It's all the more frustrating because Nelson really does find his voice on each song here, a fact that's apparent on the three songs he has to himself...","Jan 20, 2015"
,40,"Nelson's voice, silky enough to sing standards, lacks the vocal grit for the blues, and he rarely works up enough energy to milk the titular cow. Most of these songs are better suited for a supper club than for a juke joint. [Oct 2, 2000]","Jan 20, 2015"
,10,"Misconceived is the polite word.","Jan 20, 2015"

,100,"A transcendent and seductively personal sound.","Jan 13, 2015"
,90,"Harris is making music that stands with -- and perhaps eclipses -- her most well-regarded work.","Jan 13, 2015"
,90,"Her songs, paradoxically both epic and intimate, shimmer and pulsate as their kaleidoscopic images and mysterious characters drift in and out of focus.","Jan 13, 2015"
,90,"This time there's less gimmickry, more sympathy for the words and melodies. Harris... has crafted 11 profound, graceful poems that rank with the best songs she's ever recorded.","Jan 13, 2015"
,80,"Five years ago she collaborated with Brian Eno and U2 producer Daniel Lanois on the ambient Wrecking Ball. Now she returns with a less intense but no less powerful new record that continues that album's heavy/ethereal vibe, courtesy of producer (and Wrecking Ball engineer) Malcolm Burn, but with a more melodic touch.","Jan 13, 2015"
,80,"Red Dirt Girl is a model of tasteful genre blending: a little bit country and a little bit electro-ambient pop.","Jan 13, 2015"
,70,"Though the album follows the path cleared by Wrecking Ball, Harris takes more confident strides... Unfortunately, a little knowledge of the recording studio can be a dangerous thing, and Red Dirt Girl occasionally crosses the line from mellow into mannered.","Jan 13, 2015"
,70,"The songs don't vary a great deal dynamically. Harris' lyrics set Red Dirt Girl apart.","Jan 13, 2015"
,60,"Alternately sparse and lush, Red Dirt Girl can be seen as a companion piece to 1995's Wrecking Ball... The diverse production only adds to Harris' earthy songwriting, adding interest to what could otherwise be lulls during the more subdued songs, and really showcases the understated lyrics that the singer has slowly become recognized for.","Jan 13, 2015"
,50,"This collection of mostly originals, her first since 1985's The Ballad of Sally Rose, is swamped in beauty: swooning vocal harmonies; delicate poetics; lilting Celticisms.... But Red Dirt Girl is stiflingly exquisite.","Jan 13, 2015"
,50,"What a weird (dishonest? ironic? clueless?) name for a record that's all literature and arty sound effects.","Jan 13, 2015"
,40,"Mud-footed trip-hop production... [Nov. 2000, p.208]","Jan 13, 2015"

,90,"Often he sings with a richness, depth and conviction worthy of Johnny Cash. [Jan 2001, p.98]","Jan 12, 2015"
,90,"Dave Alvin brings an authentic voice and extraordinary understanding to his chosen tracks.... This is the work of a scholar as well as a master craftsman.","Jan 12, 2015"
,84,"As always, Alvin's guitar work is wonderfully supple and emotive, and stands out as the centerpiece of his arrangements. But, even more gratifying, a decade after leaving the Blasters, in which his brother Phil handled the vocal duties, Alvin has finally found his voice as a singer.","Jan 12, 2015"
,80,"His music remains lively and contemporary even when he reworks traditional songs old enough to have their copyrights lapse into the public domain.","Jan 12, 2015"
,80,"Alvin's approach acknowledges the haunting quality that traipsing through history can evince; Public Domain is like a photo album of ghosts, where the images are recognizable but occupying some other plane.","Jan 12, 2015"
,80,"The resonant and smooth singing takes some getting used to if you're familiar with earlier, craggier, quirkier recordings, but by the gallant train-wreck tragedy of 'Engine 143', I found myself singing along.","Jan 12, 2015"
,80,"Alvin injects these historic tunes with his own modern flavoring that keeps them fresh in light of their aging repose.","Jan 12, 2015"
,80,"He takes on the American songbook to stirring effect-often without relying on traditional arrangements.","Jan 12, 2015"
,70,"The handsomely produced Public Domain is so rich in history that it could do brisk business in the Smithsonian gift shop. Rather than just revisit folk gems like 'Walk Right In,' 'Delia' and 'Railroad Bill,' Alvin completely reinvents them.","Jan 12, 2015"
,70,"His loving treatment of these 16 tunes (counting one hidden track) is testament to both the rich legacy of American music and Alvin's own reverence for things past.","Jan 12, 2015"
,58,"It's not that these songs are all obvious or overdone--this nonfolkie had never heard a few of them. It's that they're so soft they squish even when Alvin tries to rev one past you, which usually he doesn't.","Jan 12, 2015"

,80,"Innovative and gorgeous, equally recalling Dionne Warwick-era Bacharach and contemporary ambient pop.","Dec  2, 2014"
,80,"A strong rebound that finds lang supported by the sleek, techno-lite production of Damian leGassick?","Dec  2, 2014"
,80,"The production... is appropriately lush and celebratory, brimming over with strings, synthesizers and layered, sensuous vocals. [July 2000, p.111]","Dec  2, 2014"
,80,"Summer's tunes have the sweetness and light of Burt Bacharach's finest.","Dec  2, 2014"
,80,"A glorious blend of surf-pop and Brazilian rhythms?","Dec  2, 2014"
,70,"The songs on 'Invincible Summer,' nearly all of them written by lang and various partners, aren't up to the standard of those on 'Drag'.... But the lyrics finally don't matter much because the record holds together as a mood piece.","Dec  2, 2014"
,60,"The music is often quick-paced fluff with the retro exactness, and the soul, of a Pottery Barn sofa. But for the most part, lang's lighter musical tack encourages her to retire the galloping self-regard that can cancel the attractiveness of her voice.","Dec  2, 2014"
,60,"If there is a fault to this album, it is that it is too smooth; while the listener is surfing these waves of happiness and cushiony pop, an occasional desire for edges and bones surfaces.","Dec  2, 2014"
,41,"What is meant to sound languid and trippy instead comes across as overwrought and pretentious?","Dec  2, 2014"
,40,"11 new songs of singularly cloying contentment; no soaring highs, no debilitating lows, just minor pop platitudes with hollow, echoing centres.","Dec  2, 2014"
,30,"Instantly forgettable... consistently tepid, devoid of personality, and characteristic of a considerable talent on auto-pilot.","Dec  2, 2014"

,91,"Winding through the psychedelic title track, the ''Rubber Soul''-ish pop, the garage rock, and the lovely ''Eire meets Tennessee'' ''The Galway Girl,'' ''Blues'' is his musical road map.","Nov 18, 2014"
,90,"Steve Earle adds yet another masterwork to his disparate collection of classics...","Nov 18, 2014"
,90,"'Transcendental Blues' is a deeply personal album steeped in pain and loneliness.","Nov 18, 2014"
,90,"Transcendental Blues epitomizes musical craftsmanship; it simmers instead of sizzles, meaning it's solid throughout and has no shortage of good songs... [w]hat is missing in the mix here is Earle at his angriest...","Nov 18, 2014"
,90,"Steve Earle proves again and again that he is the original alternative to the glossy side of Nashville.","Nov 18, 2014"
,83,"It's not precisely rock and roll, more a summary of the stylistic fusion that has evolved over his last five albums: unequal parts rock, bluegrass, folk, Irish, and punk.","Nov 18, 2014"
,81,"Earle's music doesn't simply mirror the transcendence of its creator; it lends transcendence to the listener as well, as all excellent music will. But what truly makes this one of Earle's best records is that he refuses to be pulled down by musical decisions. It's as if he never faced a problem of whether or not to add this or that instrument, or to veer off in this or that direction. He simply had the idea and went with it.","Nov 18, 2014"
,80,"Transcendental Blues measures up to the tough artistic standards Earle has set for himself since 1986's Guitar Town.","Nov 18, 2014"
,80,"Extending his winning streak to five albums, he's become a paragon of quality and musical honesty.","Nov 18, 2014"
,80,"This may be the Steve Earle album for people who've never been Steve Earle fans before.","Nov 18, 2014"
,80,"Some of the best music he's created since his release from prison on drug charges nearly six years ago.","Nov 18, 2014"
,80,"The writing shines throughout... Steve Earle seems able to do anything he cares to.","Nov 18, 2014"
,80,"Earle has let the spook out of the closet, so he can bare his spiritual chest (as it were) with a Lennonesque honesty and a vocal delivery that increasingly resembles Tom Petty's sub-Dylan sneer.","Nov 18, 2014"
,80,"There is no doubt that his songwriting chops just keep on getting better.","Nov 18, 2014"
,70,"Transcendental Blues is an intermittently twangy, often trippy and, yes, generally transcendent outing.","Nov 18, 2014"

,100,"The album navigates effortlessly from peak to peak.","Nov 10, 2014"
,90,"The most fully realised Lambchop record, the most perfect blend yet of their alt country roots and their obsession with soul.","Nov 10, 2014"
,90,"By any criteria an astonishing work.","Nov 10, 2014"
,90,"Nixon sounds like the Superfly soundtrack recorded in a different dimension, one in which Mayfield and Marvin Gaye met up with Lawrence Welk for an impromptu jam session.... a drowsy near-masterpiece.","Nov 10, 2014"
,90,"A near-masterpiece of magical sounds that are both familiar and wildly new, a stunning blend of classic Americana and classical orchestration.","Nov 10, 2014"
,80,"Piled high with elegant strings, horns, and vibraphone, these 10 tracks mark a new sophistication for this talented group.","Nov 10, 2014"
,80,"Music this laid-back but this deep, so full-bodied and yet so restrained, could only have been made by Lambchop.","Nov 10, 2014"
,80,"Heartbreaking, gorgeous and totally individual, these big-production numbers meld the different but complementary beauties of Nashville country and sweet soul while adding a dash of wine-dark weirdness.","Nov 10, 2014"
,80,"Expansively orchestrated, Nixon ultimately comes off as beautiful but slightly disturbing...","Nov 10, 2014"
,70,"[Lambchop vocalist Kurt] Wagner shares a sense of offbeat phrasing and doleful humor with his singer-songwriter friend Vic Chesnutt that is both profoundly Southern and affectingly universal.","Nov 10, 2014"
,65,"Nixon serves as a reminder that expertly executed stylistic hybrids and ironic juxtapositions-- great though they may be-- don't replace memorable songwriting. Sure, it's a novel concept, but while some of us may still be patient enough to 'get it' five albums into the band's career, Wagner's talent and unique vision should demand a more challenging album.","Nov 10, 2014"
,60,"This will still strike most as a mighty odd record, though. Ostensibly much of this record was inspired by former president Richard Nixon (there is even a suggested reading list of Nixon-related books on the sleeve). But there are no direct references to him, and even any indirect ones are so oblique that you'd never make the connection if the record had a different title...","Nov 10, 2014"
,40,"'Nixon,' Lambchop's fifth solo LP, does have its moments, some of them truly glowing. But much of the rest of the album turns toward precious self-indulgence.","Nov 10, 2014"

,91,"Even more than, speak of the devil, Garth Brooks, she's a creature of the recording industry and the smorgasbord-of-the-air it's laid out everywhere. Are the emotions she displays so pithily as synthetic in the end as her harmonica-with-strings or steel/slide guitar? Does that make them less real?","Nov 10, 2014"
,90,"Luckily her sixth full release has some true charm, with some fine blue-eyed soul and slickly produced rock. But the production tries too hard to align her with Sheryl Crow's growling sound.","Nov 10, 2014"
,90,"Her latest, I Am Shelby Lynne, is not a country record, but rather a graceful hybrid of roots rock influences and Muscle Shoals soul that adds up to one of the most intimate, earthy and adult pop-rock records in recent memory.","Nov 10, 2014"
,90,"Rarely does a relative unknown come across with an album as fiercely confident and fully formed as this.","Nov 10, 2014"
,80,"Don't misunderstand. I Am Shelby Lynne is a standout... Still, if the range of reference marks Lynne's hard-won liberation from cookie-cutter Nashville, there's a different sort of plasticity to this sound, which may explain why it broke not in the heartland or on VH1, but the U.K.","Nov 10, 2014"
,80,"Fortunately, Lynne has the material to back up the declaration, and in erstwhile Sheryl Crow producer Bill Bottrell (who co-writes most of these tracks), she's found a partner in tune with her genre-blurring aspirations, liberally mixing elements of country, blues, R&B, and lounge-infused jazz, yet still accommodating the occasional drum machine and synthesizer.","Nov 10, 2014"
,80,"Stylistically, Lynne steps out in several directions and gives the impression that she could succeed in any of them: the warm caress of her voice and the cool, cutting edge of her songs suggest great things.","Nov 10, 2014"
,77,"There is much temptation in all of this, but little satisfaction. It all sounds like someone named Shelby Lynne, for her voice is impeccable throughout. But despite its title, the album comes no closer to suggesting who she might be than her previous outings have. And too few of the songs -- despite their technical virtuosity -- beg to be played over and again.","Nov 10, 2014"
,70,"The weaknesses of this ten song collection come in the occasional over orchestration found on some tracks that would do well in succumbing to the subtlety that Lynne and her producer Bill Bottrell have mastered in other spots.","Nov 10, 2014"
,70,"Scattered about this engaging, enigmatic disc is a bit of Dusty in Memphis, a touch of Bobbie Gentry's swamp-country persona, a hint of Prince's instinct for making voices and rhythms sound positively libidinous, and a whole lot of Shelby Lynne.","Nov 10, 2014"
,70,"It ain't Dusty Springfield's Dusty in Memphis, but it's close.","Nov 10, 2014"
,60,"So why doesn't 'I Am' quite hit the mark? Blame it on producer Bill Bottrell, best-known for his work with Sheryl Crow. Simply put, he lays it on a little too thick.","Nov 10, 2014"
