8;Often considered one of the finest releases of the 2000's, Yankee Hotel Foxtrot finds Wilco in a much more soothing and contained light than their previous releases. The instrumentation is luscious and ambitious, and are backed up by Tweedy's beautiful lyrics and vocal delivery. The album may fail to engage me all the way through, but there's no denying that an album that has songs like 'I am trying to break your heart', Jesus, etc' and 'Ashes of American Flags' in it deserves a big place in history.;0;0;09/04/2016
10;I love the Lumineers.  I bought this album right before I got the terrible news that one of my friends had passed away and it carried me through the mourning process, like a family member would, like a best friend.  When it gets to Slow it Down, I really am ready to act like I've been there before, 'smile less and dress up some more.'  But it wasn't just that.  It is an uplifting album, in a boyfriend-ish kind of way, like hot chocolate and marshmallows on a rainy day.;0;0;08/28/2016
10;Great album, the use of imagery is extremely impressive.  Creative song ideas and clever lyrics separate this album from most other music out there. I have listened to it a thousand times and doesn't get old.;0;0;06/08/2016
7; The Lumineers '  uma forte contrapartida, que,  mesmo no sendo to cativante em alguns pontos, ainda se demonstra um deleite para os ouvidos e at mesmo para o corao.(B);0;0;05/15/2016
7;"Loretta Lynn is some kind of musical anomaly. How she manages to keep producing high-quality, pleasant-as-hell golden age country records 50 years later is beyond me, but she sure does. Full Circle is loosely themed around a revisiting of her entire career. Most songs here are reworkings of other, older tunes, including a version of (apparently) the first song Lynn ever wrote. Full Circle is an ode to one of the most consistent folk/country artists out there...if not the most, decades later.77/100";0;0;03/29/2016
8;Great songwriting, and the musicianship is top notch. I look forward to seeing what is in store for Rayland. It seems like he's best is in front of him.;0;0;02/09/2016
