AllMusic,80,"Exodus of Venus is an achievement both redemptive and transformative.","Oct  7, 2016"
American Songwriter,80,"A welcome if particularly edgy comeback that positions the album as Cooks finest, most riveting and intensely personal work.","Oct  7, 2016"
PopMatters,80,"Cooks mostly melancholy music contains rough diamonds whose brilliance needs to be brought out in the cutting.","Oct  7, 2016"

American Songwriter,100,"Clearly this is a heartfelt, meticulously crafted package for a cult artist who deserves far more acclaim and respect from a wider audience. As a single disc, non-boxed set re-release, its everything this classic deserves and a beautifully realized example of how reissues should be done.","Sep 16, 2016"
Dusted Magazine,80,"Allen writes like a painter, renewing familiar material--in this case, poorly behaved men and resourceful hookers with Spanish names--via quirks of perspective and peculiar taste in details.","Sep 16, 2016"
Record Collector,80,"On an initial spin, the listener likely wont understand Juarezs cult appeal or indeed Allens own obsession. However, as superbly documented by the excellent liner notes and art prints (reproducing the 1974 lithographs that accompanied the albums initial 50-run release), repeated listens will quickly have Juarez clawing at the brain and the heart.","Sep 16, 2016"
The Independent (UK),80,"Its a fascinating oddity streaked with sex, violence and sorrow, a sort of seedcorn of the Robert Rodriguez aesthetic, presented complete with the lithographs that accompanied the original, albeit in cramped CD size.","Sep 16, 2016"
Pitchfork,80,"His sparse yet driving music and the trenchant visual work accompanying are noteworthy elements of Allens four decades as an artist, but what stands out in revisiting Juarez now is the stunning poetry of the lines themselves. Allens words are a piquant kick throughout: raunchy, pithy, and richly redolent.","Sep 16, 2016"
PopMatters,80,"Juarez is an experience, one that can break your heart with the sweetness of What of Alicia or Dogwood or put the sting of whiskey in the back of your throat with the hard, crass thumping of Border Palace or There Outta Be a Law Against Sunny Southern California.","Sep 16, 2016"
Blurt Magazine,60,"As incisive a crime story as ever committed to a groove, Juarez is striking and surreal, a torrid and twisted pastiche stirred from decadence and desire.","Sep 16, 2016"

PopMatters,80,"Theres no grandstanding on this modest yet confident record. Rather theres the humility, humour, wisdom and hard-won truths of country music at its best.","Jun 17, 2016"
Spin,80,"Full Circle is like an afternoon on the front porch listening to Lynn tell you her life story, a trajectory with an impact that no single disc could ever fully sum up.","Jun 17, 2016"
The Observer (UK),80,"It feels like a simultaneous (re)introduction to Lynns career, and a summing up, and makes for a worthy companion piece to Cashs American Recordings.","Jun 17, 2016"
Boston Globe,80,"Through 13 glorious tracks spanning back-porch hootenanny sessions to countrypolitan elegance, Lynn proves that at 83 shes a national treasure who still exudes the earthiness of her rural roots.","Jun 17, 2016"
Pitchfork,80,"Only a interpreter as shrewd and tasteful as Loretta Lynn could find the inherent commonalities in these songs, and make a grab-bag late-late-career album like this feel not only emotionally grounded, but like a powerful choice.","Jun 17, 2016"

Consequence of Sound,75,"Unvarnished emotion and simple language rolling off her imperfect voice like poetry cemented Lynns legacy; Full Circle tries to preserve it for posterity, but with an addendum. Mortality squiggles blatantly through on two new songs.","Jun 17, 2016"

Pitchfork,67,"Going Down in History may not mark a sea change for Langford and company, but between the humor, the honky-tonk, and the affable, full-bodied sound, its an awesome chance to catch up.","May 20, 2016"
Record Collector,60,"While most tracks capture the hell-for-leather energy and countrified cruises of the Waco Brothers renowned live shows, the album also enjoys diversions such as the early Rod Stewart-like ballad Orphan Song and an unlikely but spirited cover of the Small Faces All Or Nothing.","May 20, 2016"

PopMatters,80,"Above the Prairie sometimes feels like a roots art record; at times your asked to consider what Radiohead might sound like if driven by wood and steel rather than ones and zeros.","Mar  4, 2016"
AllMusic,70,"Eventually, the songs do sink in, but the reason to return to the album is its ability to conjure a specific feeling, whether it's the second the sun sets or the moment that paved highway gives way to backwoods dirt roads.","Mar  4, 2016"

PopMatters,80,"Melodically engaging and narratively compelling, Things That Cant Be Undone furthers the case for Corb Lund as one of the best contemporary country songwriters.","Feb 26, 2016"
Boston Globe,80,"For all the lyrical power of those songs (and others here), the albums most affecting moment may be its most plain-spoken: At the sets end, Lund shares a song about a young niece who died of cancer, Sunbeam, that brims with quiet, heartfelt beauty.","Feb 26, 2016"
AllMusic,80,"The pairing of Lund and Cobb on Things That Can't Be Undone is a feather in both their caps; as an album, it forges a new path in country music, yet remains exceptionally close to the tradition's heart.","Feb 26, 2016"
Exclaim,80,"It's thrilling and moving to hear Lund indulge his serious side on this gorgeously forlorn new LP.","Feb 26, 2016"
American Songwriter,70,"Cobbs touch could use a little more grit overall, but Lund delivers an enjoyable romp that gets points on diversity. The album displays his impressive lyrical skills and enough sparks that could catch fire in tougher live versions propelled by rowdy crowds and concert electricity.","Feb 26, 2016"
Mojo,60,"It's great credit to both Lund and his versatile backing bad, The Hurtin' Albertans, that such see-sawing through genres can sound so much like a singular piece of work. [Dec 2015, p.93]","Feb 26, 2016"

AllMusic,70,"Imaginary Man presents Baxter and his material in a manner that's vividly passionate and a little swampy while avoiding cliches as he offers these sketches on life and love in the American South; it's a big step forward for Baxter, and will hopefully help him gain the audience he deserves.","Jan 22, 2016"
Paste Magazine,70,"Mostly, Imaginary Man sounds like Baxter composing a conscious push to the mainstream. Its just that his previous, strange, and wanderlusting alter-ego seems to capture more curiosity.","Jan 22, 2016"

AllMusic,80,"What sets Romano apart is the natural, ineffable blue mood of his sad songs, which hit the heart dead-on without ever sounding forced, as well as his impressive studio techniques, all of which are on display on Romano's fourth solo album, 2015's If I've Only One Time Askin'.","Oct  9, 2015"

AllMusic,60,"Houndmouth have the right touch and impressive chops, but this album makes it clear they needs a songwriter who can make their music seem fresh even as it's modeled on the past.","Jun  9, 2015"

NOW Magazine,60,"Despite the evident talent of his backup band  vocalists Patti Griffin and Jill Sobule, guitarist Smokey Hormel, bassist Don Was and Giant Sand's Howe Gelb on piano  it takes a while to get into, in part because the arrangements are often so busy that they verge on chaotic.","Sep  6, 2011"

Spin,70,"With pedal steel by Buddy Cage (Dylan's Blood on the Tracks), ominous percussion by Sonic Youth drummer Steve Shelley, and Buckner's usual subtle craftsmanship, he creates wasted-night rhapsodies that demand you lean in close--however warily.","Aug 16, 2011"
Paste Magazine,66,"While the album at times requires careful attention to fully attach to, it's modestly flavored with a warmth and ease that naturally rings true.","Aug 16, 2011"
Delusions of Adequacy,60,"Our Blood doesn't leave me wanting more, it doesn't leave me drooling over another listen, and it sure doesn't leave me interested in more of Richard Buckner's work. But on the same measure, it doesn't leave me sick or angry.","Aug 16, 2011"

Boston Globe,80,"Add Lauderdale's terrific musical stylings, the twangy expressiveness of his singing, and his backing ensemble's crack playing, and what results is a classic bluegrass sound that is yet just a turn off-center.","Aug  2, 2011"
American Songwriter,80,"Stretching out with a few more solos would have given listeners a better bang for the buck, and made it more of a true bluegrass record. But if they make a few more albums, Lauderdale and Hunter may well end up attaining the almost mythical status of some of America's great writing teams. That's how good they are together.","Aug  2, 2011"
Country Weekly,70,"The turquoise-hued bluegrass offered here is anything but generic--it's specialty-shop stuff.","Aug  2, 2011"
AllMusic,70,"Few current bluegrass acts sing with the command and authority Lauderdale brings to his performances, and fewer still have a set of songs at their disposal as good as what Lauderdale and Hunter have composed for Reason and Rhyme, and it's another impressive installment in what's becoming one of the most interesting partnerships in roots music today.","Aug  2, 2011"
Austin Chronicle,67,"Together, Hunter and Lauderdale straddle what Ralph Stanley calls 'mountain music' and a contemporary ethos with phenomenal ease.","Aug  2, 2011"
The Guardian,60,"There's nothing to quite match Hunter's collaboration with Jerry Garcia on Friend of the Devil, perhaps, but the surreal Tiger and the Monkey, the lazy shuffle of Jack Dempsey's Crown, and the witty, bad-tempered old-timer's song Don't Give a Hang are far more original than most bluegrass offerings.","Aug  2, 2011"

American Songwriter,80,"On Eleven Eleven, Dave Alvin continues his transformation from journeyman musician to becoming one of the people he always idolized: the one of a kind bluesmen and storytellers, rock and rollers and poets, folk singers and road warriors whose influences he's absorbed since he was a kid growing up fast in Downey, California.","Jun 21, 2011"
AllMusic,80,"Eleven Eleven  shows he's a long way away from running out of ideas, and these 11 portraits of life in the Golden State are engrossing, thoughtful music that should satisfy old fans and engage those introducing themselves to his work for the first time.","Jun 21, 2011"

Paste Magazine,84,"It's hard to believe Don't Blame the Stars has been floating around for more than three years. Hard to believe because, a) It's a terrific album that a label should have snatched up earlier, and b) It's eerily prescient.","Jun 20, 2011"
PopMatters,80,"You are moved nearly to tears while also being provoked to think about the very act of a song moving someone to tears.","Jun 20, 2011"

Pitchfork,75,"DeCicca's delivery, alternately grim and genial, sometimes averages out into nonchalance, and some of the black humor in these lyrics is a bit funnier on paper than on the record itself. But he's always been sort of a tricky read as a singer, allowing Sayre's ever-present violin to hammer home the emotional content, and Don't Blame the Stars finds the two neatly complementing one another.","Jun 20, 2011"
AllMusic,70,"Other than the annoyances listed, Don't Blame the Stars is an enjoyable, fairly well-executed album of decent Americana songs. No more, no less.","Jun 20, 2011"
The A.V. Club,67,"While The Black Swans' sound is well suited for regretful laments about antidepressants and anxiety, the band is at its best when it lightens up a bit. Given the background of Don't Blame The Stars, perhaps that's too tall an order.","Jun 20, 2011"

AllMusic,80,"At the age of 64, Emmylou Harris has made an album as fresh and distinctive as any in her catalog, and Hard Bargain is a reminder that her evolution into a songwriter is one of the most pleasant surprises in a career that's produced rewarding music for nearly 40 years.","May 31, 2011"
Paste Magazine,80,"A solidly sung, played and written collection of songs, it is a very fine release that will almost certainly find a welcome reception from her longtime fans.","May 31, 2011"
Austin Chronicle,78,"Nashville's harmony constant wrote/co-wrote all but two of the 13 tracks on her latest career high, though the Ron Sexsmith cover titling Hard Bargain demands its very own songbook.","May 31, 2011"

The Independent on Sunday (UK),60,"It is stately, rather imperious music, conveying emotion through the deployment of technical effects rather than through the revelation of a voice.","May 31, 2011"
American Songwriter,60,"Harris' vocal approach to her folk-based songs, ballads or mid-tempo, is infused with the presence of a time-traveler, visiting modern America from a pre-pop-culture place where music is in the air rather than the airwaves.","May 31, 2011"
musicOMH.com,60,"The lingering sense, though, is one of repetition. Now the novelty of her songwriting has worn off, she needs to find a whole new language again.","May 31, 2011"

Under The Radar,70,"The band's debut album, Broken Side of Time, is a coherent work fashioned from a throwback aesthetic.","Mar 16, 2010"
The New York Times,70,"The combination of seismic guitars and high vocals looks to My Morning Jacket, Kings of Leon and Crazy Horse--sometimes all too obviously. But Alberta Cross sets aside those American bands redemptive undercurrents of blues and gospel; instead, it plunges into the very English despair of bands like Pink Floyd.","Mar 16, 2010"
AllMusic,70,"Its a slow burner with nary a hook in sight, and vocalist/guitar player Petter Ericson Stakees theatric mumbles can be an acquired taste, but listeners with a CD collection that leans heavily on bands like Catherine Wheel, Sixteen Horsepower, the Cult, and Kings of Leon will find this dense monolith of roots-based stoner rock to be the perfect late-night companion for a dark summer highway.","Mar 16, 2010"

Absolute Punk (Staff reviews),95,"Walker has truly outdone himself with an album that captures all the nuances that made 'Letters And Meadows' shine, and extracts them bit by bit to give every individual track its own breath.","Mar  9, 2010"
AllMusic,80,"Michael Trent receives co-writing credits for roughly half of these tracks, but I Liked It Better When You Had No Heart is a Butch Walker album through and through. Its also one of his best, proof that Walker still cant take a step without bumping into a usable hook.","Mar  9, 2010"

PopMatters,80,"When all is said and done, its doubtful that I Liked You Better When You Had No Heart will go down as Walkers definitive statement as an artist, nor will it significantly expand his loyal following.  What it will do, however, is simply reaffirm to everyone that Butch Walker is still one of the most creative, consistent, and flat-out exciting artists working in the industry today, commercial prospects be damned.","Mar  9, 2010"
Sputnikmusic,70,"Despite the minor grievances and sore-thumb songs, and the fact that it's unreasonable to compare this record to its near-flawless predecessor, I Liked It Better When You Have No Heart is a sterling addition to Butch Walker's celebrated discography.","Mar  9, 2010"

PopMatters,60,"Taken in isolation and away from their intended meaning, most every song on the album sounds like a Grade A piece of Americana, but its almost impossible to distance these songs from their whole, and it would be disrespectful to both Farrar and Gibbard to do so, which in turns makes the album more of a nice attempt to pay respect to Kerouac from two fan boys than a legitimate tribute to one of Americas most famous and influential writers.","Feb  9, 2010"

The A.V. Club,90,"For the most part, Ghost channels its shaggy sound into pop music. True, it's pop music that constantly threatens to erupt into noise or fade into silence, but it's still hard not to hum along.","Jun 22, 2004"
Delusions of Adequacy,90,"A work like this is only self-indulgent if its accoutrements aren't justifiable. Wilco makes every note count on this album: however miraculously, it all manages to cohere. And the songs are undeniably stunning.","Jun 22, 2004"

Los Angeles Times,88,"The songs are structured firmly in the classic tradition, evoking Dylan, the Band, Hendrix and Beatles. They're enriched by a bottomless well of melodic invention and find an emotional core in Tweedy's shy, plaintive vocals. [20 Jun 2004]","Jun 22, 2004"

Stylus Magazine,59,"Theres really nothing to this record.","Sep 24, 2002"
Pitchfork,55,"While Demolition forgoes the overproduction and even much of the shameless rock-god posturing that plagued Gold, Adams hasn't yet found his way out of his songwriting rut.","Sep 24, 2002"
Blender,40,"Honors shifts in style over substance. [#11, p.124]","Sep 24, 2002"

Splendid,90,"Revealing itself slowly, like the mythic tales acknowledged by the album's title, Folklore is certainly Sixteen Horsepower's most stunning and accomplished work yet, and an easy nominee for one of 2002's best.","Aug  6, 2002"
PopMatters,90,"The album marks the high point of an amazing band's amazing career.","Aug  6, 2002"
AllMusic,90,"This is a landmark in the subgenre of alt-country goth","Aug  6, 2002"

Almost Cool,80,"Would most likely appeal to everyone from fans of Will Oldham and Palace Music to everyone who bought the recent Oh Brother, Where Art Thou? soundtrack and wanted to branch out a bit into some slightly (but still thematically similar) territory.","Aug  6, 2002"

Pitchfork,79,"The album crawls from the speakers like a stabbing victim and gives up a great moan; it's a difficult listen, but the rewards are great.","Aug  6, 2002"

Q Magazine,60,"It's familiar, but immaculately done, and by far the most focused work this band has managed thus far. [Sep 2002, p.100]","Aug  6, 2002"

Mojo,100,"A masterpiece, exactly the sort of record that your average sentient pop genius should make in 2002. [May 2002, p.99]","Apr 23, 2002"

Pitchfork,100,"Complex and dangerously catchy, lyrically sophisticated and provocative, noisy and somehow serene, Wilco's aging new album is simply a masterpiece; it is equally magnificent in headphones, cars and parties.... No one is too good for this album; it is better than all of us.","Apr 23, 2002"
Entertainment Weekly,91,"''Yankee Hotel Foxtrot'' is a subliminal album. Spin it once and it barely registers. Play it five or six times and its vaporous, insinuating, rusty-carousel melodies start to carve out a permanent orbit in your skull.","Apr 23, 2002"
Almost Cool,90,"I'm not sure if it's the work by O'Rourke or the progression of the group (or a little of both), but this disc is so multi-layered that it's easy to hear new things many many times after the first listen.","Apr 23, 2002"

Village Voice,80,"Yankee Hotel Foxtrot is basically a good album, even a great album if you're in the mood, though if you listen to a lot of hip-hop (or house music or basement bhangra or any other genre not dominated by white people), it probably won't be the most extraordinary album you'll hear all month.","Apr 23, 2002"
Uncut,80,"The most common description of this much-discussed album over the past few months is that YHF is Americana's Kid A. In truth, it's more successful than that. [May 2002, p.112]","Apr 23, 2002"
CDNow,80,"Like so many great fuzzy rock albums, from the Rolling Stones' Exile on Main Street to R.E.M.'s Murmur, it takes a few listens to seep into your bloodstream.","Apr 23, 2002"

Dot Music,80,"Tweedy takes conventional songforms birthed on his acoustic guitar and scrambles them completely, reassembled into fractured, dissonant epics with the help of the reliably brilliant Jim O'Rourke.","Apr 23, 2002"
Q Magazine,80,"Battered, bonkers and bewitching in equal parts, Yankee Hotel Foxtrot at last finds Wilco's 'interesting' phase becoming downright fascinating. [May 2002, p.121]","Apr 23, 2002"
Blender,80,"Tweedy whittles down the arrangements and drops in enough experimental nuances to make the whole thing sound refreshingly lo-fi. [Jun/Jul 2002, p.116]","Apr 23, 2002"
Rolling Stone,80,"An earthy, moving psychedelia, eleven iridescent-country songs about surviving a blown mind and a broken heart.","Apr 23, 2002"

Ink Blot Magazine,90,"Every song contains four or five things that will just whip your head around in disbelief.","Feb 19, 2002"
Nude As The News,90,"For all its minimalist musical approach and inherent gloominess, Is A Woman over time proves a creative masterstroke.","Feb 19, 2002"
Dot Music,80,"'Is A Woman' is a deep, rewarding, frustrating, baffling, engaging experience then, an album that drifts away from you just when you're getting hold of it.","Feb 19, 2002"
AllMusic,80,"By focusing less on quotidian (i.e., boring) experiences of the proletariat and more on less-tangible allusions to death, troubled romance, and loneliness, Wagner's music is simply more approachable and meaningful, if still hard to puzzle out in its specific intent.","Feb 19, 2002"

The Wire,80,"A record that urges you to lean closer to the speakers in order to fully hear everything that is being played and sung. [#216, p.63]","Feb 19, 2002"
Splendid,80,"The album sounds full whether you're in the next room or sitting right beside the speakers. Details -- a horn here, a steel guitar there, a lilting piano figure that appears out of the ether -- fill every cranny in a sound that's still as spacious as Giant Sand's Southwestern soundtracks.","Feb 19, 2002"
Mojo,70,"These gradual pleasures fly in the face of today's pop/rock hardsell, for sure, but inexorably you are drawn into Kurt's world. [Mar 2002, p.100]","Feb 19, 2002"
Rolling Stone,60,"With repeated listens, what feels at first like unmelodic obduracy reveals some hidden charms.","Feb 19, 2002"

Pitchfork,58,"Is a Woman is a disappointment.","Feb 19, 2002"
Q Magazine,40,"One very minimal idea being stretched over 11 songs to the point that it starts to look very washed-out indeed.","Feb 19, 2002"

Stylus Magazine,67,"It is when Adams veers from the hook-orientated path that the record suffers.","Sep 25, 2001"
Pitchfork,60,"Gold comes off as clean, shiny, and over-the-top as Elliott Smith's XO, replete with strings, horns, and female backup singers. I double-checked the credits. Jon Brion wasn't listed.","Sep 25, 2001"
AllMusic,60,"The album seems to reflect craft rather than passion, and while it's often splendid craft, the fire that made Whiskeytown's best work so special isn't evident much of the time.","Sep 25, 2001"
PopMatters,60,"The stylistic mix is dizzying, from Dylanesque odes to Motown soul, but more than that, Adams's influences are so prominent that you often feel like you're listening to other people.","Sep 25, 2001"
