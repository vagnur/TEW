NOW Magazine,80,"The tales they tell are, while gruesome, well told.

The New York Times,80,"Scheherazade isn't exactly the Feel Good Album of 2016, but being lost and forsaken with Freakwater is a more satisfying experience than feeling perky with most other acts, and Scheherazade is a brilliant reminder of what Catherine Irwin and Janet Beveridge Bean do so strikingly well.","Apr  1, 2016"
Exclaim,80,"Longtime fans who have patiently waited for this resurgence will be thrilled with results that gently tug at the boundaries of their established sound.

American Songwriter,75,"Theres something invigorating about hearing two alt-country veterans take apart their tried-and-true sound and reassemble it slightly askew, and Scheherazade is not only their most modern-sounding record; it might be their best since Old Paint.","Apr  1, 2016"
Q Magazine,70,"Overall Scheherazade is a masterful step forward for Freakwater with an eye on its influences and history. Its songs grapple with duality, with a balance between muddy, dirty roots music and clear, split open beauty, and the album balances itself so well in that regard.","Apr  1, 2016"

AllMusic,75,"Despite its clear seriousness, Brigid Mae Power runs on that sense of newfound freedom. Power and Broderick find glimmers of light even in the darkest moments, and she learns to trust the kind of love that enables independence, after some period of coercion.","Mar 18, 2016"

PopMatters,40,"Efficient in conjuring intense emotion, the album has the hallmarks of a temporary success, but Plattens identity gets lost.

Uncut,72,"Not to underestimate the experiences behind Reid's lyrics, but the loss of faith that unravels throughout the record comes off a little grave, reminiscent of those fogged post-heartbreak moments where it's impossible to believe you'll ever be happy again....

Mojo,50,"Ultimately, it takes a real curmudgeon to dislike this often enchanting, rosy-cheeked, harmony laden alliance, even if you wish it was better.

Record Collector,80,"Fleeting achieves something each Jones record has worked toward, to create a geography of sound, to make these notes from guitar and banjo feel like the creaks and groans of an old house, to make you picture the dust pluming off each plucked string, to see the motes drifting through sunlight pouring through a nearby window.","Nov  6, 2015"

Magnet,100,"By breaking down the barriers that separated these three albums, The Cutting Edge shows how for Dylan during this blinding, brilliant peak his music was a living thing, evolving from song to song, take to take, where the quest itself was as transcendent as the final destination.","Oct 30, 2015"
PopMatters,100,"The 65-66 era of his career occupies rarefied space in the annals of rock; The Cutting Edge somehow demystifies it and makes it seem more impressive all at once.

AllMusic,100,"For anyone remotely interested in how great art is made, [the deluxe edition] is the equivalent of an audio master class as Dylan works, reworks and reworks again the song until it sonically captures the energy, defiance, outrage, empathy, celebration and liberation embedded in the lyrics.","Oct 30, 2015"
Blurt Magazine,100,"To this day, Dylan regards the studio as an artifact-making machine and not a magical chamber freezing definitive versions of his songs.

Paste Magazine,70,"A follow-up thats every bit as charming and melodious as their first.","Oct 16, 2015"
Boston Globe,60,"The addition of Hammond, fiddle and nicely understated guitar make So Familiar one of the strongest tracks with Edie Brickell reining in the often drawly mannerisms of her singing style to accompany with great effect.

PopMatters,90,"Rodriguez has been hinting at the ambition displayed on Lola for some time. What's surprising is how a record of such scope and imagination can be rendered so intimately and elegantly.","Sep 25, 2015"
Record Collector,80,"Antique pieces such as Cuco Snchezs Que manera de perder are wrung for their stately melodrama, while originals like La ltima vez and I Dreamed I Was Lola Beltrn take Tex-Mex into classy, modern terrain, steel guitars ringing alongside cantina strumming.","Sep 25, 2015"
The Guardian,80,"This is a fresh, confident set.","Sep 25, 2015"
The Observer (UK),70,"While not the starting point for one to enter the musical world of Carrie Rodriguez, the creative left turn that is the wondrous Lola is further proof Rodriguez can move the heart in any language.","Sep 25, 2015"
Mojo,67,"'Si No Te Vas' sounds exactly as if Rodriguez was in a callejn serenading her lover even with the hint of gringo in her Rs. Picking up Spanish as an adult can cause that, yet it lends the music an authentic border feel, the bridge between worlds. Therein lies the cohesiveness between old and new that makes Lola a love affair worth taking home and introducing to la familia.","Sep 25, 2015"

Uncut,80,"Sonically, Manhattan is one of Lewis' clearest, best-recorded and arranged albums to date, with masses of swirling, atmospheric sounds augmenting the more detailed tracks (the sounds of crowded New York City streets and subways seep into some of the songs).","Sep 25, 2015"

Dusted Magazine,80,"The tales they tell are, while gruesome, well told.

Drowned In Sound,80,"Scheherazade isn't exactly the Feel Good Album of 2016, but being lost and forsaken with Freakwater is a more satisfying experience than feeling perky with most other acts, and Scheherazade is a brilliant reminder of what Catherine Irwin and Janet Beveridge Bean do so strikingly well.","Aug 21, 2015"
Tiny Mix Tapes,80,"Longtime fans who have patiently waited for this resurgence will be thrilled with results that gently tug at the boundaries of their established sound.

New Musical Express (NME),75,"Theres something invigorating about hearing two alt-country veterans take apart their tried-and-true sound and reassemble it slightly askew, and Scheherazade is not only their most modern-sounding record; it might be their best since Old Paint.","Aug 21, 2015"
Magnet,70,"Overall Scheherazade is a masterful step forward for Freakwater with an eye on its influences and history. Its songs grapple with duality, with a balance between muddy, dirty roots music and clear, split open beauty, and the album balances itself so well in that regard.","Aug 21, 2015"

PopMatters,80,"Servant of Love is an album that needs a few spins to be fully appreciated, but it's as sincere, heartfelt, and artful as anything Griffin has released to date, and if the form may seem elusive to some listeners, the content is powerful and satisfying, a reminder of why Patty Griffin is one of our best singer/songwriters.","Aug  7, 2015"

Magnet,80,"Colvin struggles with the Bands complex Acadian Driftwood, but otherwise shines.","Jun 29, 2015"
PopMatters,70,"Uncovered could be considered a sequel of sorts. Here again, Colvin culls the set list from the efforts of others. In a way, its more adventurous than before, due not only to the diversity of her sources (Bruce Springsteen, Paul Simon, Tom Waits, Stevie Wonder et. al.), but also to the stripped down approach which finds her sharing the spotlight with producer Steuart Smiths acoustic guitar and little else in the way of additional accoutrement.","Jun 29, 2015"
Los Angeles Times,70,"Overall, Uncovered stands up as much as you could want a cover album to; Colvin puts her own folk spin on things and keeps that sound strong throughout.","Jun 29, 2015"
The Wire,67,"Uncovered, the longtime local's second covers album, both respects its material's wellsprings and celebrates them through a different, and at times unrecognizable, lens.","Jun 29, 2015"
Record Collector,60,"Colvin needs to bring something new to the songs, but for the most part does not perform them much differently than the older tunes.","Jun 29, 2015"
Mojo,60,"Uncovered feels slightly spare and quiet in comparison [to 1994's Cover Girl]--there are no productions as bright and full as that on 'Every Little Thing She Does Is Magic'--but it follows the same basic formula as that album, with Colvin finding the quiet, intimate heart lying in each of these songs.","Jun 29, 2015"

PopMatters,60,"Wildfire is the work of a determined singer/songwriter who prizes craft over poetry or introspection.

Paste Magazine,40,"Efficient in conjuring intense emotion, the album has the hallmarks of a temporary success, but Plattens identity gets lost.

AllMusic,80,"Old fans of Gundersens EPs and Ledges might want something that seems less polished, as well as songs that dive even deeper into religious matters--this is not a somewhat inaccessible indie album. It is, however, melancholy beautiful pop that explores some of livings hard questions.","May 26, 2015"

Uncut,80,"he Wainwright Sisters' voices blend together perfectly, and the melodies here are calming--almost too much so. A close listen to the lyrics, though, reveals the darker side of bedtime stories.","May 12, 2015"
AllMusic,80,"Some people may see Songs In The Dark as a curio, simply recorded for in order to keep the legacy of the McGarrigle canon alive and well. Yet its the black humour and obvious love for the material that lifts this into another sphere.","May 12, 2015"
Austin Chronicle,80,"Its a wonderful collection, with even Richard Thompsons cold-comfort message in End Of The Rainbow imbued with a warm glow.","May 12, 2015"
PopMatters,70,"This is not the Music for Little People style of cute professionalism. Songs in the Dark reach back to the roots of traditional music for kids when it was sung as much to provide solace for the parents as well as to entertain the kids.","May 12, 2015"

Boston Globe,100,"he Bootleg Series Vol. 12: The Cutting Edge 19651966 is more than just music--its cultural history of colossal significance.

Punknews.org (Staff),100,"By breaking down the barriers that separated these three albums, The Cutting Edge shows how for Dylan during this blinding, brilliant peak his music was a living thing, evolving from song to song, take to take, where the quest itself was as transcendent as the final destination.","Apr 21, 2015"
Under The Radar,100,"The 65-66 era of his career occupies rarefied space in the annals of rock; The Cutting Edge somehow demystifies it and makes it seem more impressive all at once. For a guy who once warned us not to look back, Bob Dylan keeps giving us irresistible reasons to do exactly that.","Apr 21, 2015"
AllMusic,100,"For anyone remotely interested in how great art is made, [the deluxe edition] is the equivalent of an audio master class as Dylan works, reworks and reworks again the song until it sonically captures the energy, defiance, outrage, empathy, celebration and liberation embedded in the lyrics.","Apr 21, 2015"
Magnet,100,"To this day, Dylan regards the studio as an artifact-making machine and not a magical chamber freezing definitive versions of his songs.

Los Angeles Times,80,"The Cutting Edge allows fans to bear witness to perhaps the most astonishing explosion of language and sound in rock history, a new approach to song being forged before our very ears.","Apr 21, 2015"
NOW Magazine,80,"At the very least, listening to The Cutting Edge 1965-1966 should send you scurrying back to the official versions of those three classic Bob Dylan albums. Its his story, and its history, reconsidered one more time.","Apr 21, 2015"

PopMatters,80,"Colvin struggles with the Bands complex Acadian Driftwood, but otherwise shines.","Jan 27, 2015"
Uncut,70,"Uncovered could be considered a sequel of sorts. Here again, Colvin culls the set list from the efforts of others. In a way, its more adventurous than before, due not only to the diversity of her sources (Bruce Springsteen, Paul Simon, Tom Waits, Stevie Wonder et. al.), but also to the stripped down approach which finds her sharing the spotlight with producer Steuart Smiths acoustic guitar and little else in the way of additional accoutrement.","Jan 27, 2015"
Exclaim,70,"Overall, Uncovered stands up as much as you could want a cover album to; Colvin puts her own folk spin on things and keeps that sound strong throughout.","Jan 27, 2015"
The Wire,67,"Uncovered, the longtime local's second covers album, both respects its material's wellsprings and celebrates them through a different, and at times unrecognizable, lens.","Jan 27, 2015"
Mojo,60,"Colvin needs to bring something new to the songs, but for the most part does not perform them much differently than the older tunes.","Jan 27, 2015"
Dusted Magazine,60,"Uncovered feels slightly spare and quiet in comparison [to 1994's Cover Girl]--there are no productions as bright and full as that on 'Every Little Thing She Does Is Magic'--but it follows the same basic formula as that album, with Colvin finding the quiet, intimate heart lying in each of these songs.","Jan 27, 2015"

Record Collector,100,"Lament For Nepal is one of three love letters to the earthquake-ravaged Kathmandu Valley. A stark Nepali bell opens and closes this haunting piece, though as is so often the case with Chapman, the English pastoral qualities of the composition are equally compelling.","Jan 27, 2015"

Pitchfork,80,"Fish at first doesnt come across as the sort of defining, revelatory work that The Resurrection and Revenge of The Clayton Peacock and, to a lesser extent, Pachyderm were, but its pleasures are more subtle, revealing themselves in increments.","Jan 27, 2015"

AllMusic,60,"Its that kind of affair: fine in parts but far too eclectic for its own good. Collins remains in fine fettle, though, and the choices are fair enough given her Broadway pedigree and eye for a standard.","Jan 27, 2015"

American Songwriter,80,"[Bachman] offers a pretty good idea of where he's coming from. If it sometimes feels like the stream of America pimitivist fingerpicking artists is neverending, Bachman does at least apply his digits to a variety of instruments. [May 2015, p.56]","Jan 27, 2015"
Q Magazine,80,"River is not only the work of a master guitarist, but also that of a sophisticated composer. Bachman's confidence in interpreting his own musical ideas on the fretboard is now equal to his skill in playing the lineage music that inspires him.","Jan 27, 2015"
Exclaim,80,"It is the first album he ever recorded in a studio, and both the clarity of the recording and the precision of the performances betray considerable effort spent getting it right.","Jan 27, 2015"

Mojo,80,"Old fans of Gundersens EPs and Ledges might want something that seems less polished, as well as songs that dive even deeper into religious matters--this is not a somewhat inaccessible indie album. It is, however, melancholy beautiful pop that explores some of livings hard questions.","Jan 27, 2015"
Record Collector,70,"While Carry the Ghost is a sullen work, with lyrics that deal head-on with reality, and processing rather than wallowing, Gundersen hits a beautifully wistful sweet spot in tone both lyrically and musically.","Jan 27, 2015"

Mojo,80,"Dalton famously believed that a singer shouldn't have to raise her voice to be heard. These minimalist arrangements, whether it's Isobel Campbell affecting a slight twang to match her guitar or Larkin Grimm legitimate twang (and the album's only banjo), are a fitting tribute in themselves.","Jan 27, 2015"
The Telegraph (UK),80,"You feel each artist shares your yearning to hear Dalton sing each song herself. Haunted and haunting.","Jan 27, 2015"

Q Magazine,70,"Whilst Still could certainly have benefitted from a greater cache of stronger songs (a couple of which could have been swapped-in from the largely electric self-produced Variations EP that comes with early CD editions), as a combined entity it holds together convincingly as an amiable summary of what latter-day Richard Thompson is all about.","Sep 16, 2014"
Record Collector,70,"With the help of producer Jeff Tweedy, Thompson knows that bitterness goes down easiest when paired with autumnal Celtic-pub melodies (see 'Josephine,' which evokes his time in Fairport Convention).","Sep 16, 2014"

New Musical Express (NME),80,"Wisely, they dont ape the original, choosing instead to retain its core components while adding snatches of flutes and strings.

Under The Radar,80,"Cohen is a genially commanding stage presence, falling on his knees at crucial moments and doffing his cap for his accompanists' solo turns. The Old Ideas songs, sprinkled throughout the set at just the right intervals, are naturally at home, capped with the wry God-speaking-to-a-man-named-Leonard 'Going Home'. Otherwise, the songs you know and plenty of songs you should know better are probably here.","Jan 21, 2014"
Magnet,80,"The Cohen here is not all that different than on the excellent two-CD set Live in London. In fact both live shows feature several of the same songs in similar order....

The Wire,80,"Although this is hardly an essential release--few live albums ever are--its no victory lap or self-indulgent unit shifter.

AllMusic,80,"The Punch Brothers sound as comfortable nimbly skipping through classical pieces as they do creating oddly shaped bluegrass-prog--and as they do creating sparkling pop miniatures like 'Magnet' and 'Between 1st and A.'

Under The Radar,80,"The melodies seemed soaked in a timeless well of American music: the album feels both new and familiar at the same time, every song a clever layering of Gunns guitars--acoustic, electric, steel, and assorted effects pedals, but all separated clearly, so theres no hint of sonic mush.

Rolling Stone,100,"The singers distinctive baritone, dry yet emotive talk/singing style and the crystal clear recording quality focuses attention on his dynamic, sometimes humorous, always poetic lyrics. The interplay with his three backup singers also brings depth and a sensuality often lacking from the studio versions, making some of these laconic and extended performances definitive.","Sep 17, 2013"
PopMatters,80,"Cohen is a genially commanding stage presence, falling on his knees at crucial moments and doffing his cap for his accompanists' solo turns. The Old Ideas songs, sprinkled throughout the set at just the right intervals, are naturally at home, capped with the wry God-speaking-to-a-man-named-Leonard 'Going Home'. Otherwise, the songs you know and plenty of songs you should know better are probably here.","Sep 17, 2013"
Magnet,80,"The Cohen here is not all that different than on the excellent two-CD set Live in London. In fact both live shows feature several of the same songs in similar order.... Despite the three hour length of the complete box set, the time moves briskly due to the variety of the songs and musical configurations.","Sep 17, 2013"
Uncut,80,"Although this is hardly an essential release--few live albums ever are--its no victory lap or self-indulgent unit shifter. Its true value lies in its function as a worthy addition to the latter-day Cohen canon, as a reminder that he is still an active, relevant artist and performer, rather than a self-aggrandising nostalgia act.","Sep 17, 2013"
AllMusic,80,"Live in Dublin reveals Leonard Cohen is actually growing and improving as a performer as his 80th birthday looms on the horizon, and this unexpected and welcome new chapter in his career continues to reap surprising and delightful rewards.","Sep 17, 2013"
American Songwriter,70,"A great deal of the material here was covered on 2009's Live in London, but it's well worth the price to hear backup singer Sharon Robinson's exquisite take on 'Alexandra Leaving,' Cohen's hilariously self-referential 'Going Home' and a finale where he covers 'Save the Last Dance for Me.'","Sep 17, 2013"


Austin Chronicle,90,"Rice hasnt changed his sound much, but his writing is still every bit as visceral as it always has been, and his long-awaited third album, called My Favourite Faded Fantasy, absolutely lives up to the legacy of his previous work.","Sep 10, 2013"
Paste Magazine,90,"What makes this effort so different is its ability to transcend those mere qualitative descriptions and transport ones mind to its most emotionally darkest corners--even if it has to clear away some of the cobwebs that we attempt to veil our pain in.","Sep 10, 2013"

AllMusic,80,"My Favourite Faded Fantasy may come on as a bit underwhelming at first but that's the intent: it's not designed to grab, it's designed to soothe and then slowly worm its way into the subconscious, which is where these eight songs reveal themselves to be as strong as anything else Rice has written.","Sep 10, 2013"
PopMatters,80,"It may not be a barrel of laughs, but My Favourite Faded Fantasy proves that nobody does hushed introspection as well as Damien Rice.","Sep 10, 2013"

Q Magazine,100,"Theres an uncommon depth here that hasnt been evidenced on Williams records in ages, both in the sonics (an immaculately crafted blend of intimate and widescreen) and the lyrics, which at times are deeply confessional and others downright defiant as the songwriter stares down her demons, the vicissitudes of relationships and the rampant idiocy of the outside world.","Sep 10, 2013"

Classic Rock Magazine,80,"Williams adapted the song from a poem by her father, Miller Williams, and it gives Down Where the Spirit Meets the Bone its emotional compass if not its melodic direction. The rest of this double album, Williamss first, settles into a deep groove that suggests the singer-songwriter was fired up and couldnt--and shouldnt--whittle her latest to a standard 10 songs.","Sep 10, 2013"
Mojo,80,"This music is taut and soulful, but also a document of one woman baring her spirit and mind to the world, which has always been the case with her best music, and if this isn't a masterpiece, it's as pure, straightforward, and compelling as anything she's done since Essence.","Sep 10, 2013"

The Telegraph (UK),70,"Throughout, Williams walks the line between tough and tender, just as she cleverly negotiates the path dividing heartland American music and the alternative, counter cultural variety. [Dec 2014, p.106]","Sep 10, 2013"
PopMatters,70,"This album stands with Williams strongest work and represents that rare thing in American popular music and its culture of celebrity.","Sep 10, 2013"
AllMusic,70,"She's tough and confrontational, and on her 11th studio album, Down Where The Spirit Meets the Bone, that toughness initially comes across as even more deeply entrenched. It takes a little while to discover the tenderness that goes along with it.","Sep 10, 2013"
Consequence of Sound,67,"Lack of focus falters the whole, but Down Where the Spirit Meets the Bone triumphs in Lucinda Williams becoming gloriously unbound.","Sep 10, 2013"
Boston Globe,60,"Vocally, Williams experiments more than ever before, almost to the point of jazzy improvisation; she drawls, mutters and often leaves phrases hanging in the air, at times reminiscent of Mary Margaret OHara. Its a welcome development and helps to make the album feel like her most accomplished in many years.","Sep 10, 2013"

The New York Times,80,"Costello, James, Mumford, Goldsmith and Giddens put their disparate origins aside and pull together as a team. They clearly own these songs, and ply them accordingly. Both credence and comradery play crucial roles here, elevating this effort to that of an essential acquisition.","Aug 13, 2013"
The Independent (UK),80,"Maybe theyre mostly polished pop songs where the 67 cuts embodied the raw, haphazard spirit of a songwriting era long gone--one that intuitively anticipated the impeccably executed Americana and folk heard on these new recordings--but the idea behind their origin will help them remain as timeless as the originals.","Aug 13, 2013"

Record Collector,70,"Lost On The River is an album of good, sometimes excellent songs with a  unique creation story which, in the end, adds little substance to the narrative of perhaps the most mythologised recordings in musical history.

The Independent (UK),61,"Nearly every track on Lost on the River has a couple of memorable moments: a marvelous turn of phrase, a brief Jim James guitar meltdown, an instant of the band members discovering how their voices can harmonize. But what it lacks is the casual joy of Dylan's Basement Tapes.","Aug 13, 2013"

PopMatters,50,"You can admire its uncompromising spirit, but you can just as easily loathe its saccharine sound.

Mojo,50,"Even though Storytone's gloppy Disney-movie strings and half-assed singing can be trying to sit through at times, the extent to which Young is willing to go to avoid resting on his laurels and making Even Longer After the Gold Rush is admirable.

The Quietus,60,"Tell 'Em I'm Gone confirms that Yusuf still has the talent and passion that made him a star as Cat Stevens, but the efforts to find a new sound for him don't quite work, and Rubin doesn't quite catch the light but emphatic touch of Yusuf's salad days; maybe a full reunion with Paul Samwell-Smith would be worthwhile for Yusuf's next album.","Jun 25, 2013"
New Musical Express (NME),58,"The production and playing are beautiful throughout the album, and Yusufs voice remains remarkably preserved, still able to instantly spring from gentle introspection to emphatic eruptions.

American Songwriter,80,"The melodies seemed soaked in a timeless well of American music: the album feels both new and familiar at the same time, every song a clever layering of Gunns guitars--acoustic, electric, steel, and assorted effects pedals, but all separated clearly, so theres no hint of sonic mush. Gunns voice is perfect, too.","Jun 18, 2013"

The Independent (UK),70,"Once you've heard the undoctored edition of Bert Jansch's heartbreaking 'Needle of Death,' a harrowing tale of self-destruction by heroin predating Young's own 'The Needle and the Damage Done,' the noisier approach feels like needless gimmickry that diminishes, rather than enhances, one of his strongest sets in a long time.","Feb  5, 2013"

The Independent (UK),60,"Now with trippier violin filigrees, they sound even more like the offspring of groups like Soft Machine and Caravan.","Jun  5, 2012"
Uncut,60,"Sound Mirrors mix of jazz rhythms and psychedelic funk cuts a distinctive, if unfashionable, path.","Jun  5, 2012"
AllMusic,60,"Sound Mirror is the mark of a band in it for the long haul who will undoubtedly get better and better as time goes by.","Jun  5, 2012"
Blurt Magazine,50,"There are still instances where the band lose sight of themselves, either not allowing the real heroes of the songs to take full control or plainly not recognizing where to trim the fat.","Jun  5, 2012"

Boston Globe,60,"In short, if you're a Dashboard Confessional fan then you'll find plenty to enjoy here. Full-blown pretty-boy emotion dished out by a musician as adept at pulling the heart strings with big, simple feelings as anyone you might care to name.","Jun  5, 2012"
AllMusic,50,"Twin Forks seems like a worthy vehicle for Carrabba's songs, but too much of this album panders to worn-out themes and clichs.","Jun  5, 2012"

The Independent on Sunday (UK),70,"Its tempting to think of Brightly Painted One as a grower of an album, and much of that depends on where you stand on the music/lyrics side of things. The problem is, for all of its evident beauty, its difficult to get inside  frustratingly so.","Jun  5, 2012"
BBC Music,70,"It all has an affecting, intimate power.","Jun  5, 2012"

Blurt Magazine,60,"She steps gingerly out of her comfort zone again on I Never Wear White, its harsh guitars veering towards garage rock, and the banjo-led angry man blues of Song Of The Stoic.

PopMatters,80,"She builds the title track around a moment of beauty and renewal, and elsewhere she sings of companionship and comfort.
