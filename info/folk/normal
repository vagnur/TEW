10,"For some reason, this album has attracted several strongly negative ratings from users, though I for one simply cannot fathom as to why. For me, this album was a real beauty, from the erratic, uncoordinated opening of 'Jonny O' the Brine', to the piano-led 'Blackbird', to the closing ballads of 'Lovely Molly' and 'The Moss House'. The whole thing just glimmers. There are some wonderfully bizarre choices of instrumentation, yet strangely this never feels out of place with the traditional folk songs of the British Isles. Special mention must also go to one or two other tracks, such as the frantic ghost story 'Willie O'; 'Airdog', which poignantly reflects on the nature between man and beast in the art of killing; and 'Phoenix Island', which features a lovely coda from the Roundhouse Choir.
So ignore the User Score (at time of writing it rests at a lowly 3.8) and purchase this wonderful sophomore effort by Sam Lee. You'll be doing yourself a favour, as its placement in yearly critical acclaim so far behind only rapper Kendrick Lamar testifies.",2,3,"Apr 12, 2015"

10,"I've been listening to Chris Thile since his Nickel Creek Days.  I loved his solo and early work as the Punch Brothers and was excited to hear that Punch Brothers would be touring in my area for their new album.
They offered a free digital copy of Phosphorescent Blues with the ticket purchase.  Upon listening, I found it appealing.  There was a slight recognition in me that this was incredible work, but with my life being so busy, I thought the album was mostly really beautiful background music as I tried to fit in listens with competing desires for other genres.
The evening of the concert arrived, and I'm afraid I won't be able to do the performance justice.  All I'll say is that I left in awe at the seeming effortlessness and joy in which all of this came together live.  Seeing the sounds sound the same, better even!, than on the album, was amazing to witness.  As a modest musician myself, it was incredibly inspiring to see the five musicians keeping the music alive.
Gabe Witcher (fiddle/violin/drums), Noam Pikelny (banjo), Chris Eldridge (guitar), and Paul Kowert (bass) were not only the members of Punch Brothers, but amazing musicians to hear and watch.  It was such a completely satisfying and uplifting concert.  I've been listening to the album, now, with newfound vision, understanding, and, dare I say it, love for the songs.

10,"For some reason, this album has attracted several strongly negative ratings from users, though I for one simply cannot fathom as to why. For me, this album was a real beauty, from the erratic, uncoordinated opening of 'Jonny O' the Brine', to the piano-led 'Blackbird', to the closing ballads of 'Lovely Molly' and 'The Moss House'. The whole thing just glimmers. There are some wonderfully bizarre choices of instrumentation, yet strangely this never feels out of place with the traditional folk songs of the British Isles. Special mention must also go to one or two other tracks, such as the frantic ghost story 'Willie O'; 'Airdog', which poignantly reflects on the nature between man and beast in the art of killing; and 'Phoenix Island', which features a lovely coda from the Roundhouse Choir.
So ignore the User Score (at time of writing it rests at a lowly 3.8) and purchase this wonderful sophomore effort by Sam Lee. You'll be doing yourself a favour, as its placement in yearly critical acclaim so far behind only rapper Kendrick Lamar testifies.",2,3,"Apr 12, 2015"

9,"Have you ever felt as if you are oppressed by a waking stupor  as if the aim of life is mere existence, rather than enjoyment or self-fulfilment? For some, their salvation from this suppression of the soul is an encounter with a new person; for others, a sense of meaning comes through a promotion or job change; for the majority of us, though, we are left with a feeling of belonging after recognising a kind word spoken or written.
It is this feeling of awakening which is embodied in Damien Rices music  none more so than in My Favourite Faded Fantasy. The title itself appears to be a metaphorical nudge to the writers block which had left the singer-songwriter bereft of the ear jangling, heart tingling introspection of which he has become synonymous. Thankfully, Damiens third album allows us to once more explore the crevices and coves of the writers mind.
Creeping up on his listeners ears like the process of days lengthening in summer, Damiens music is welcoming and warming. Arriving at the first perceptible lyric or chord is fulfilling; and when no more may be heard you are left dissatisfied. Alone.
This emotion is the one which Damien is master of. It is immensely difficult for anyone to notice a moment within his swelling discography in which Damien is not carving himself open, playing Whack-a-Mole with his emotions, to present himself as truly as possible. Nowhere has this been presented as earnestly as in The Greatest Bastard. Even the most resistant of listeners would struggle to notice in this an ode to former acquaintances, friends and band mates. I never meant to let you down, yells Damien, as the music peaks and then subsides. Musically speaking, this album has far from let us down.
Like his two preceding full-length releases, O and 9, My Favourite Faded Fantasy is propelled and distorted by its effect on the listener. No two people could identify the same sounds or instruments in their first listen of Long Long Way, say. Layers of sound and string/wind instruments need to be heard as independent entities, all building towards the same denouement or meaning as one another but via their own, individual routes.
It is often the crescendos which pinch, or tap at, the heart when you are exposed to Damiens music. Sometimes a deafening silence abruptly draws to its close a section of warring violins. While, at one notable moment, a clarinet rises from the ether, transporting the listener from Long Long Way to the end of the album.
When the listener arrives at this point, after 48 minutes of archetypal Rice soul-searching  and, for the most part, he is still searching  they are able to look back at the ground covered. Behind them is a memorable sight (or, to appropriate the metaphor, sound). Yes, there are moments which taint our golden-tinted impression of the album: the lyrics of the chorus to I dont want to change you are fanciful at best, meaningless at worst. However, the implications of Damiens lyrics and the heartfelt character of his imagery are as  if not more  present than ever. While a dogless bone reeks of his earlier like a rootless tree, his songwriting remains captivating and often original.
2011, noted for the releases of James Blakes first full album, and Justin Vernons follow-up to the mesmerising For Emma, Forever Ago, was considered the year of introversion in contemporary music. Damien Rice did not produce a solo record that year. Nor had he penned and released a song during the period in which Mumford & Sons, Ben Howard and Ed Sheeran pricked the general publics consciousness to hysteria. That writers block lasted eight years. In which time, the unthinkable breech was bridged in American politics; global economic structures toppled and were rebuilt; and Little Mixs B*witched inspired, electro shambles left Damien confronted with the Devil.
Years of escapism from the medias steely and judgemental glare; years of emotions being meshed, mashed and masked; years of contemplative self-reflection  this is the makeup of My Favourite Faded Fantasy.
Combined, what does this complex ensemble amount to? A piece of art, 48 minutes in length, which sounds as seminal as O.",1,1,"Nov 11, 2014"
10,"This album is next to perfect. All biases about him as an artist aside, if I had never heard of him and this was the first album I heard from him I'd find it hard to top.

Those who were disappointed by '9' will not be disappointed by this!",0,0,"Nov 12, 2014"
9,"It had gotten to the point where I assumed Damien Rice would spend his days living a modest life of the proceeds of his globally successful 'O' and the relatively less successfull follow up '9'. Contribute the odd song to a charity compilation, keep a low profile and eventually get to a point  where he could walk around Dublin without being recognised. 8 years is a long time between releases for anyone but especially in modern times for a singer songwriter who seemed on top of his game. 'My Favourite Faded Fantasy' comes, not quite out of the blue, but as an unexpected addition to the Damien Rice discography. Best of all, it adds greatly to that discography. Second album '9' was a patchy effort next to the faultless debut 'O'. To sign off on '9' would have left the impression the Kildare troubadour had run out of stream. After 8 years we get just 8 tracks on 'My Favourite Faded Fantasy' but they are worth every days of the wait. The opening title track starts off with delicately plucked guitar and softly sung vocals which builds to a stormy crescendo, a trick Rice has pulled to great effect before on the likes of 'I Remeber'. 'It Takes A Lot To Know A Man' is built around a tasty piano loop which breaks down at around 5 minutes, to be followed up a building instrumental outro that carries on for another 4 minutes or so. 'The Greatest Bastard', possibly autobiographical, sounds like the Damien Rice of 'O', similar chord sequence to 'Older Chests' but with a middle 8 and outro that is simply spine tingling. Rice chose 'I Don't Want To Change You' as the main single from the album and you can see why. Sweeping orchestrations across a beautiful yet typically downbeat love song, this track reaffirms Rices's place at the top table of Irish songwriters and makes what has come from other artists over the last decade or so pale in comparison. 'Colour Me In' is another gentle, gorgeous number drowned in strings and emotion. The album is almost exclusively written on acoustic  guitar with a massive focus on Rice's immaculate vocals. Where he was previously prone to the odd rage filled angry delivery, 'My Favourite Faded Fantasy' sees Rice's vocals consistently silky. 'The Box' is the closest we get to angry Damien, another building track, starting out almost in silence and finishing in a hurricane of swirling strings and emotion. This is probably my favourite track from the record. 'Trusty and True' is a pleasant 8 minute affair that looks to grow itself into an anthem. As good a track as it is, its the only song on show that I'm not head over heals in love with. 'Long Long Way' finishes the album in the same epic tradition as Rice's other closers 'Eskimo' from 'O' and 'Sleep Don't Weep'. Its got a bit of a Sigur Ros vibe to it and again is spectacular, with a female vocalist that sounds uncannily like Rice's previous musical partner Lisa Hannigan.  8 years in the making and well worth the wait, 'My Favourite Faded Fantasy' is a triumph that every music lover needs to check out.",0,0,"Aug 18, 2015"

8,"Hozier has enjoyed an incredible level of success in a relatively short time on the scene. Less than 2 years after releasing his first EP and within months of releasing his debut album, Hozier is now a household name across the planet. There is no doubting the man is talented but so are many other artists who work and tour endlessly in the hope of getting their music heard, all to no avail. What sets Hozier apart from all the rest? To me it is down to him making the right video for the right song at exactly the right time. Whether it was on purpose or pure luck, Hozier's song 'Take Me To Church' and more importantly the video that went with it. At a time when gay rights is not only an important and topical issue but also a huge populist issue (as seen in the build up to and results of the May 2015 marriage referendum in Ireland), the video to 'Take Me To Church' fed into the Zeitgeist. Good luck to Hozier with it - its a great song and deserves to be heard. The annals are full of one hit wonders but Hozier has successfully followed up his breakthrough hit with a string of others. While nothing on the eponymous 'Hozier' comes close to the 9 out of 10 'Take Me To Church', it is an album that deserves a pat on the back for its consistency. Every 2 or 3 years, an artist breaks through with an album seemingly loaded with hit singles and proceeds to take over the global airwaves. As it is, 'Hozier' already sounds like a greatest hits compilation. You can see why the record has been such a commercial success - the music is catchy, current and has more or less a universal appeal. That said, it will be interesting to listening back in a couple of years and see just how well it lasts - I feel Hozier lacks the depth of the truly great solo artists and his worth will only really be seen across his next few albums.",0,0,"Jul 31, 2015"

9,"On his debut, Irish singer-songwriter Hozier draws on his influences of blues, soul and folk and twists them into his own image.
Gothic-esque undertones are present throughout the album, particularly on tracks such as 'Take Me to Church' and 'From Eden'. Hozier's lyrical skill is evident on 'In a Week', which features Karen Cowley on vocals. The song is set in the Wicklow Mountains, commonly associated with death and murder in Ireland. The vocal interplay between Hozier and Cowley is hauntingly beautiful.
'Someone New' adds a mainstream feel to the record whilst still rooted in the blues style. Songs such as 'To Be Alone' and 'Angel of Small Death and the Codeine Scene' draw on the garage-blues evident in the work of The Black Keys and Jack White's solo material.
The album though, does not come without a couple of weaker tracks, in particular on 'Sedated', which on most albums, would be considered to be an album highlight, but the quality of the album as a whole makes the song seem slightly redundant among the rest of the record.
The album's final track, 'Cherry Wine' is a fantastic album closer, and adds a brilliant balance to the moodier tracks on the second half of the record, especially 'Work Song' and 'It Will Come Back', the latter, arguably, the strongest track on the entire LP.
As a whole, Hozier has a great deal to offer, and the fact the album is not (strictly speaking) a mainstream blues record only adds to its appeal. It is not a perfect record by any means, but very few are, especially in modern mainstream music. However, there is enough on this record to suggest that Hozier will be at the forefront of mainstream music for many years to come.

Rice chose 'I Don't Want To Change You' as the main single from the album and you can see why. Sweeping orchestrations across a beautiful yet typically downbeat love song, this track reaffirms Rices's place at the top table of Irish songwriters and makes what has come from other artists over the last decade or so pale in comparison. 'Colour Me In' is another gentle, gorgeous number drowned in strings and emotion. The album is almost exclusively written on acoustic  guitar with a massive focus on Rice's immaculate vocals. Where he was previously prone to the odd rage filled angry delivery, 'My Favourite Faded Fantasy' sees Rice's vocals consistently silky. 'The Box' is the closest we get to angry Damien, another building track, starting out almost in silence and finishing in a hurricane of swirling strings and emotion. This is probably my favourite track from the record. 'Trusty and True' is a pleasant 8 minute affair that looks to grow itself into an anthem. As good a track as it is, its the only song on show that I'm not head over heals in love with. 'Long Long Way' finishes the album in the same epic tradition as Rice's other closers 'Eskimo' from 'O' and 'Sleep Don't Weep'. Its got a bit of a Sigur Ros vibe to it and again is spectacular, with a female vocalist that sounds uncannily like Rice's previous musical partner Lisa Hannigan.  8 years in the making and well worth the wait, 'My Favourite Faded Fantasy' is a triumph that every music lover needs to check out.",0,0,"Aug 18, 2015"

8,"20 tracks spread over almost 2 hours, this is a big dose of music from an artist Ive long admired.  Well-written, well-performed and well worth the $5 Amazon download, this album would have knocked someone out of my 2014 top ten list if I had invested the time to listen to it a few months ago.
Some instant classics pop out of this colossus.  Cold Day in Hell is a smoldering break-up song, in which she assures her former lover that it will be a cold, cold day in hell before he gets to use and confuse her again.  Its a honky-tonk slow dance classic, with wailing guitar solos that break your heart.
Wrong Number is cut from the same cloth.  Simple slow music sung with intensity.
Its not only sad slow songs on this album, though.  Stand Right by Each Other brings a little energy to the party, in the form of a make-up song:
Babe I care too much, I won't give up that easy
So give me that much, baby don't give up on me
If you could see yourself the way I see you baby
Then you could see for yourself why I don't want nobody else
We gotta stand right by each other
We gotta try harder baby
I got stand right by you
And you gotta stand right by me
Youre never going to hear Lucinda Williams warble a glossy Taylor Swift dance number, but theres a clear-eyed optimism that prevents her from being a Debbie Downer.  She explains her approach in When I Look at the World:
I've been out of luck
I've been talked about
I've been locked up
I've been shut out
I've had some bad dreams
Ive been filled with regret
I've made a mess of things
And been a total wreck
I've been disrespected
and taken for a ride
I've been rejected
and had my patience tried
But then I look at the world
in all its glory
I look at the world
And it's a different story
each time I look at the world
It doesnt hurt the album that she assembled some great musicians to accompany her.  Some critics have complained that the album feels padded with extra guitar playing, but theyre simply wrong.  The guitar work on this album provides the bedrock that everything else grows on  it transforms the lyrics from barely passable poetry to expressive music.
Speaking of poetry, the title of the album comes from a poem written by her father.  She reworks the poem into the opening track, and its a beautiful piece that stands apart from the rest of the album.  Always show compassion, she advises in a lean acoustic setting, because what comes across as conceit, bad manners or cynicism is

The Ceaseless Roar is a very good album and it really turns me on to Robert Plant's solo work.

8,"Hozier has enjoyed an incredible level of success in a relatively short time on the scene. Less than 2 years after releasing his first EP and within months of releasing his debut album, Hozier is now a household name across the planet. There is no doubting the man is talented but so are many other artists who work and tour endlessly in the hope of getting their music heard, all to no avail. What sets Hozier apart from all the rest? To me it is down to him making the right video for the right song at exactly the right time. Whether it was on purpose or pure luck, Hozier's song 'Take Me To Church' and more importantly the video that went with it. At a time when gay rights is not only an important and topical issue but also a huge populist issue (as seen in the build up to and results of the May 2015 marriage referendum in Ireland), the video to 'Take Me To Church' fed into the Zeitgeist. Good luck to Hozier with it - its a great song and deserves to be heard. The annals are full of one hit wonders but Hozier has successfully followed up his breakthrough hit with a string of others. While nothing on the eponymous 'Hozier' comes close to the 9 out of 10 'Take Me To Church', it is an album that deserves a pat on the back for its consistency. Every 2 or 3 years, an artist breaks through with an album seemingly loaded with hit singles and proceeds to take over the global airwaves. As it is, 'Hozier' already sounds like a greatest hits compilation. You can see why the record has been such a commercial success - the music is catchy, current and has more or less a universal appeal. That said, it will be interesting to listening back in a couple of years and see just how well it lasts - I feel Hozier lacks the depth of the truly great solo artists and his worth will only really be seen across his next few albums.",0,0,"Jul 31, 2015"
10,"In a soulful and consistent record, Hozier sings with a certain melancholic tone that in conjunction with the choir and string arrangements make this album an anthem for those who love, suffer and enjoy blues, rock and folk music.",0,0,"Jul 13, 2015"
9,"On his debut, Irish singer-songwriter Hozier draws on his influences of blues, soul and folk and twists them into his own image.
Gothic-esque undertones are present throughout the album, particularly on tracks such as 'Take Me to Church' and 'From Eden'. Hozier's lyrical skill is evident on 'In a Week', which features Karen Cowley on vocals. The song is set in the Wicklow Mountains, commonly associated with death and murder in Ireland. The vocal interplay between Hozier and Cowley is hauntingly beautiful.
'Someone New' adds a mainstream feel to the record whilst still rooted in the blues style. Songs such as 'To Be Alone' and 'Angel of Small Death and the Codeine Scene' draw on the garage-blues evident in the work of The Black Keys and Jack White's solo material.
The album though, does not come without a couple of weaker tracks, in particular on 'Sedated', which on most albums, would be considered to be an album highlight, but the quality of the album as a whole makes the song seem slightly redundant among the rest of the record.
The album's final track, 'Cherry Wine' is a fantastic album closer, and adds a brilliant balance to the moodier tracks on the second half of the record, especially 'Work Song' and 'It Will Come Back', the latter, arguably, the strongest track on the entire LP.
As a whole, Hozier has a great deal to offer, and the fact the album is not (strictly speaking) a mainstream blues record only adds to its appeal. It is not a perfect record by any means, but very few are, especially in modern mainstream music. However, there is enough on this record to suggest that Hozier will be at the forefront of mainstream music for many years to come.

10,"My first review of this album a week ago was a '8.' Since then, I had a chat with one of the guys who works at a record store here in Chicago, and he recommended Marissa's albums. Since then, I went to her back catalogue on iTunes and fell in love with most of the songs on 'Ballads of Living and Dying.' But the song 'Bird On Your Grave' on her 'Song III: Bird On The Water' EP is what clinched it for me. My mom died a couple of months ago, and I sometimes sing the songs she used to love to feel closer to her. Well, it just so happens, In that song, this is exactly what Marissa puts in her lyrics:  '...been dead a couple of months, my friend;' '..and I still have your songs in my head, and your face engraved into the glass of me;' and lastly, 'Tomorrow I'm going to leave a bird on your grave, and say a little prayer for you.' Well, it just so happens - yet again - that I found a beautiful stone bird carved and painted in Mexico at a thrift store awhile back, and I've been looking at it and how I would have shown it to my mother who was Mexican. Now I have wrote 'I love U Mom' on the bird and am going to place it on her grave, and of course, say a prayer.  If this isn't the most sad but one of the most beautiful songs Marissa has written. So you can see why I also love her album 'Ballads of Living and Dying' as well. I'm giving this album a '10' because I think it's an '8,' but I have added an extra '2' points for the 'Bird On Your Grave' song from 2007, and the connection I feel with Marissa's music is amazing!

My second review (and I was damn compelled).
(I don't know what this means to the individual reader, but) I am in a Celtic band myself, playing Irish and Scottish songs, and then some. I play Irish bouzouki and mandolin, and though I'm not native to Texas, I have taken lessons for both instruments at an Irish Music retreat in Texas, called O'Flaherty's. I've been learning more and more about Celtic music since I started playing it and studying it in my early teens in 2010.
On the other hand, I'm also very passionate about indie music, orchestral music, experimental music, instrumental music, minimalism, world music etc.
I'd always wanted to incorporate Celtic music into the music that I wrote, because I love it so much. Doesn't help that I'm part Irish and Scottish. However, most fusions of Celtic music--like and especially The Dropkick Murphys and other pub-rock bands--weren't my ideal choices, so I wanted to fuse it with something else. Something I could enjoy more.
Today I found out I was beaten to the punch. And I'm so glad: I couldn't have thrown one harder.
Indie meets Irish... but mostly Irish. It really works.
Every song on here, first to last, is genuinely wonderful and expertly varied, from the haunting and brooding 'Song 44' to the sixteen-minute amalgamationary epic 'Opening Set' to the lovely finisher 'Samradh Samradh.' The really impressive thing is that it feels cohesive, too, and not just by way of individual tracks: the whole album successfully feels pieced together properly.
Some songs that I'm used to hearing fast, like 'Allistrum's March,' are slowed down to a crawl, and the effect is stunning. I won't lie: on my first listen I was moved to tears. It's the most beautiful rendition of the song I've heard. It's a toss-up between that and 'Freedom / Saoirse' as my favorite songs on the album, the latter of which is remarkable in it's on right: beautiful, powerful, but never overblown, with the chord progressions and melodies remaining memorable throughout.
From quiet to loud, slow to fast, smooth to harsh, the elements fit together wonderfully. Thomas Bartlett (aka Doveman)'s piano works, even though he's not trained in Celtic music, as far as I know, add a sort of magic to the whole business that lend heavily to the sound. Martin Hayes and Caoimhin  Raghallaigh's fiddle parts are precise on every featuring, whether they be on the slow, moving songs or on the dexterous runs of the reels, calling for disciplinary agility. Dennis Cahill's guitar works are subtle and beautiful and, like Doveman's piano, provide a crucial background for everything else to stand in front of. Finally, Iarla O'Lionaird's Sean-ns style singing, while it might not immediately impress on the opening song, is stunning. His voice is graceful, powerful, and wide. One song he sings low and another he's singing high. Together, the quintet come together to form what deserves to be called one of the most impressive supergroups of Irish music.
Please, please check out this album. It's a fresh, new, exciting, varied, and rock solid effort from five class-acts, American and Irish, who have taken Irish music to ground both familiar and higher. Some traditionalists might find the need to balk at this album, but even the stoniest of the elites should be moved by this; if not, they should at least acknowledge the effort as something fresh, notable, and beautiful one way or another. Not everything may fall under the category of 'How Irish Music Is Supposed to Be Done', but what's been done has been done. And all I can do is applaud the results.

8,"'Grass Punks' is a lovely grass roots acoustic guitar album created by the ever-interesting raconteur Tom Brosseau.  Brosseau's storytelling is one of the standout aspects of his music, with his gentle vocals also drawing the listener in as if you were listening to the words of a close friend.  He is masterful at creating a personable space for his audience within the finger-picking melodies of his twin guitar band.  Two men, two acoustic guitars, vocals and backup vocals.  It hearkens back to a simpler time in music, which is refreshing, and something that I feel Brosseau wanted to achieve with 'Grass Punks'.  This is never more obvious than with the first track 'Cradle Your Device', which is a charming social commentary taking a swing at our transfixed obsession with our smartphones rather than paying attention to those around us.  Wry, charming, and ultimately very calming in nature, the album is a real treat for any lover of acoustic singer/songwriter music that is not bombastic or over-the-top.

Vega has always been a great songwriter with an ability to make a song out of the most simple of things and once again, her talent for blending poetry with melody is at the forefront of her work. 'Realms' won't win Vega a new generation of fans but will please her existing fanbase. While there may not be a 'Luka' or a 'Marlena' on this, there are a few nice new additions which should appear on future set lists. I particularly like  'I Never Wear White', 'Song of the Stoic' and 'Laying on of hands'.

10,"My first review of this album a week ago was a '8.' Since then, I had a chat with one of the guys who works at a record store here in Chicago, and he recommended Marissa's albums. Since then, I went to her back catalogue on iTunes and fell in love with most of the songs on 'Ballads of Living and Dying.' But the song 'Bird On Your Grave' on her 'Song III: Bird On The Water' EP is what clinched it for me. My mom died a couple of months ago, and I sometimes sing the songs she used to love to feel closer to her. Well, it just so happens, In that song, this is exactly what Marissa puts in her lyrics:  '...been dead a couple of months, my friend;' '..and I still have your songs in my head, and your face engraved into the glass of me;' and lastly, 'Tomorrow I'm going to leave a bird on your grave, and say a little prayer for you.' Well, it just so happens - yet again - that I found a beautiful stone bird carved and painted in Mexico at a thrift store awhile back, and I've been looking at it and how I would have shown it to my mother who was Mexican. Now I have wrote 'I love U Mom' on the bird and am going to place it on her grave, and of course, say a prayer.  If this isn't the most sad but one of the most beautiful songs Marissa has written. So you can see why I also love her album 'Ballads of Living and Dying' as well. I'm giving this album a '10' because I think it's an '8,' but I have added an extra '2' points for the 'Bird On Your Grave' song from 2007, and the connection I feel with Marissa's music is amazing!

9,"Once I Was An Eagle is the fourth album from Laura Marling and with producer Ethan Johns they have created a masterpiece. Shy in her live performances on record this English rose turns the spotlight on herself and opens up in a way that is both honest and brave. The album, split into two sections by an interlude, is a stripped back affair, just guitar and cello with the occasional flurry of drums or keys allowing the listener easier access to Marlings exquisite voice and confessional lyrics. The opening suite of seven songs manage to blend almost seamlessly and yet amazingly retain their individuality. Guitar motifs crop up throughout as Marling sings of loss, heartbreak and naivety and it is in this first section that all the comparisons to Joni Mitchell will be made. But there are also traces of Dylan especially in the Master Hunter with its Tangled Up In Blue/It Aint Me Babe hybrid. The second half of the record is closer to her previous work and has more elements of Dylan but also nods to The Band, Velvet Underground, acoustic Zepplin and Aimee Mann. It is less raw than the first half but only just and the songs are slightly more fleshed out with instruments but the quality remains the same. Marling has the ability in her voice to range from angelic highs to whiskey soaked rasps that add real dynamics to these tales of relationships gone awry. But I think the most striking thing here is how mature the content and the song writing are, let us not forget that Marling is only 23. With an album this good its hard to know how she will ever be able to top it but for now we can just savour her Blood On The Tracks.",3,3,"Jun  1, 2013"
10,"Without a doubt a masterpiece of an album. Laura has always poured her heart and soul into every offering and in that way, Once I Was An Eagle is no different. There is a lot of heart here. But she ultimately feels empowered on this album. She sneers, she laments and she offers advice, all from a superior vantage point (hence eagle). She has always sounded like an old soul in a young body (she's only 23), but with this record she skillfully balances wisdom with reckless abandon. There is immediacy here, there is the odd bit of savage six-string banging and as always there are subtly beautiful pieces. It feels entirely cohesive, honest, well thought out and well risked. Best album of the year for me.",2,2,"Sep  6, 2013"
10,"Laura flies low, under the radar. Since my initiation to her music on 'From the Basement' where she performed 'Your Only Doll (Dora)' and blew me away. Since, I've managed to see her 10 times live, though I live 'far away' in California. But not apparently so far since she's moved to LA. (She responds by returning to London for 'hundreds' of surprise performances. She also wrote some songs for the Royal Shakespeare Company. I've seen her perform many of these songs live. Now I can try to realize from the Album that and how all this music comes as a whole. Because this is an 'Album' as it was in the old days. There's a lot to digest in this album, but that makes the listen sound like a challenge. Laura is a great singer, guitar player, composer, and Performer. It just gets better.",2,3,"Jun 12, 2013"
10,"(Written for an English assignment)
Marling and her guitar are back again, and like drips of water steadily becoming a stream, Take The Night Off begins. Marling's voice is more enchanting than ever (long gone is the slightly irritating estuary English from parts of Alas, I Cannot Swim) The easy, soothing introduction to Eaglemakes way for frenetic percussion and rising and falling guitar chords, reflective of Ms. Marling's new found avian alter-ego. The first four songs interlink, in the style of an Indian Raga, twisting a turning, changing shape and form, as Marling's liquid voice releases lyrical gem after lyrical gem.
It's true, as many reviewers have stated, that the first half of the album (Take The Night Off to Devil's Resting Place) is more united thematically than the second. However, it's in the second half that you realise that Marling must have some Well of the Muses stored in her garden, because she draws from so many emotions and viewpoints. Delicate strands and ideas all pulling together, bringing Eagleinto a second dimension.
She has clear influences, yes. Something most reviewers mention, and she's been called a 'third-rate Joni Mitchell' by one reviewer, but it's not where she draws from, it's where she takes them to. Master Hunter clearly alludes to Tangled Up In Blue, Bob Dylan's ode to love. Little Bird has bossa nova influences from time to time, and Undine has Blue Grass touches with it's lilting guitar mastery. However, the lyrics transcend her forbears, and the melody rises to the occasion. A masterpiece.",3,6,"May 28, 2013"
7,"'Once I was an Eagle' seems to be a somewhat aftermath of Marling's previous effort 'A Creature I Don't Know' (an album which has grown to be one of my favourites, not just by her). The overall production and style is reminiscent of her third album, but with a noticeably more minimal approach, notably in the first half of the album. The opening four tracks merge seamlessly together to create a 16 minute soundscape centred on her and her guitar, and this continues...throughout the whole album, with sparse instrumentation which continues and continues, in fact, this does not change until the 10th track 'Where Can I Go?' where we are introduced to a light drumkit and pretty organ.
Her lyrics on the other hand never cease to impress me, the way she takes characters form her own life and her own thoughts and reflects all these in her songs is unique to her and shows her influences from the folk greats. Her ongoing maturity as a songwriter is evident in this album, contrasted with her debut album 'Alas I Cannot Swim'. Not only her lyrics, but her voice has also grown up with the music she produces, and the way she presents her person through the microphone could not have been any different for this album.
The low point of the album for me is definitely 'Little Love Caster'; this seems to be a very tedious and almost self indulgent noddle on the guitar, strongly reminiscent of the previous album's track 'Night After Night'. Despite the interesting musical ideas and lyrics, the natural sound effects seem to be an overly pushed gimmick in my opinion.
My favourite track is definitely 'Where Can I Go?', where she explores the lyrical theme that suits her best, harkening to her younger past and acknowledging a 'curse' and constantly addressing the listener. The guitar plays few chords and is backed up by a beautiful organ part which swells along with the song to the end, but doesn't build to a climax.
I believe several tracks like 'Once' and 'Master Hunter' save this album from being a lackluster affair of banality, but it's the contrast between the near humdrum of tracks like 'You Know' and 'Devil's Resting Place' (seems more than just a reprise of 'Master Hunter') and these more interesting, adventurous songs that make this album the intriguing piece of art that it is, showing Marling's diverse guitar playing, captivating lyrics and her massively developed sound  credit to Ethan Johns in the progression from Charlie Fink's stuck-in-the-world-of-just-folk production.",0,2,"Jul 14, 2013"
7,"I enjoyed the album. The lyrics are mature, her voice and singing is great to listen to, and the music is serene. The production is also appreciated. I specifically liked how the first half felt like one big track, as every end of a song had the same music of the next one's beginning.
However, i'm not sure if i'll be remembering any of this by the end of the year. While it's pretty good, i can't consider it a 'masterful work' like some seem to call it.",0,0,"Jan 26, 2014"
9,"The only artist whose progress from a precocious 17-yr old to a mature 23-yr old, I have followed fervently. And yet again, she doesn't disappoint. 'Once I was an Eagle', is a progressively more mature and an elaborate album from this virtuous folk musician. This album for once and for all corroborates, the parallels drawn by critics to- Joni Mitchell and Bob Dylan.
For this album she teamed up with Producer/Percussionist Ethan Johns and cellist Ruth De Tuberville, the trio have a characteristic dark intimacy that perfectly compliments the songs that are acerbic and emotional.
The first 7 songs form the first part of the album, are segued together as each song morphs into another and are impossible to pick apart. The profundity of her very cogitative lyrics, that first catapulted her to fame, is even stronger on this one. In the title song 'I was an Eagle' she draws an analogy of an eagle as herself and dove as her hapless lover, which establishes her as a very clever poet. With each song the metaphorical analysis of her waning romance immerses the listener so deep as he/she is bound to tag along into a surreal journey of empathetic catharsis. We can also see her guitar playing prowess in 'Little Love Caster'.
The second part of the album starts with an interlude, where you again see the wonderful trinity of the three immensely talented musicians. Then what follows is another spell of brilliance, with songs like 'Where can I go?' and 'Once', completely taking over the listener and is bound to draw in more easy-listening fans, thanks to its beguiling tune and Marling's distinctive speak-singing.
This album is redolent of her imperious character, as a person, with songs like 'Master Hunter' substantiating that hypothesis. Some may argue of intrinsic androgynous element in the album, but I for one, don't really find it so, as she is just asserting her stand on things. I also find critics all over, drawing out correspondence of the album to her past lovers, I feel that it is a direct encroachment on her privacy, because let's be clear here, she is a poet (yes she is) and personally speaking, contrary to popular belief, very rarely real-life experiences give rise to poetry or in this case lyrics, her maturity in every album remains a testimony to that.
Let's face it, yet again, her brilliance will go unnoticed as she can never stoop down to the 'POP' (Programming pun here) level. But with 4 impressive albums at this young age, she is going to be a legend, not implying she isn't already, but I am talking of being in the ranks of Bob Dylan and Joni Mitchell.",0,0,"Nov 19, 2013"

9,"A big album. A bit too long for so heavy musics... Anyway, Laura Marling made her best work in Once I Was an Eagle. The first four songs introduce the person in her aura, which is softened after the Intelude and broken in the last song. One of the best albuns of 2013",0,0,"Jan 17, 2014"
10,"It's hard to imagine a more blissful combination of pain and paradise than hearing Patty Griffin on this stripped down, heart-broken-open recording.  MASTERPIECE!",2,2,"May  9, 2013"
10,"I have long wondered why Patty Griffin isn't more well known if not downright revered for her art.  American Kid makes that gap between her achievements and notoriety seem even stranger.  She has put forth collections of perfectly sculpted songs for years, too many masterpieces to recount at this point.  American Kid is her finest accomplishment to date.  American Kid is not the same sort of collection of miniatures Griffin typically releases.  It's unified by theme in a way her other albums have not been, save Downtown Church.  It's a whole, fully formed work.  Nothing she has ever done has felt more personal, and that is saying a lot, considering her distinctive ability to hit the heart and soul with that one of a kind combination of singing and songwriting.  The people in these songs, veterans, slaves, lovers, sons, God himself, fathers, especially her own, walk in to the room during these songs--her word choices are that perfect and evocative in each turn of lyric and note.  This album also seems to carry with it the weight of American history, the history experienced by men like her father, men now leaving the earth, people long past and forgotten.  Anyone who has known these men or who has lost someone they love or seen a love end too soon will cherish this album.  Patty seems determined in these songs to commit their stories (most poignantly her father's story) to memory for all time.  American Kid is a stunning achievement.  A masterwork by one of our great living singer/songwriters.  No one who still values the craft of song-making and songwriting should leave this album out of their collection.",1,1,"May  9, 2013"
9,"Stunning album, and the best I have heard this year. Patty Griffin has always amazed me with her storytelling and musical ability, and this album is probably the best collection of focused songs that she has released. Wild old dog, go wherever you wanna go, that kind of lonely, and not a bad man are among immediate standouts, but the album flows wonderfully and is full of excellent lyrics, great music, and diverse production. I think you will struggle to find a more touching and beautiful album this year. Excellent.",1,1,"May  9, 2013"
10,"I've run out of words to describe the greatness of Patty Griffin. If she's ever written a bad song, it hasn't been recorded. She's a genius at conveying the details of simple moments to immerse you in the story, to make you feel like you've been somewhere you've never been. She's not just a great poet, she's an insightful voice. American Kid is a masterpiece and sonically is quite different than her other albums. Listen to the first 4 tracks and tell me she isn't the best songwriter alive today.",1,1,"May  9, 2013"

It's boring and the melodies aren't that intriguing. None of the songs even throw you for a loop with an interesting change partway through. This band used to be my favorite but it seems like they are just digging a hole at this point. Only good song is 'In the Morning' which I should mention could have been a great song but they never push it to that next level and pretty much just let it repeat.",0,1,"May  5, 2013"

Lots of noise and sound, part of what makes it an incredible album.",0,0,"May 24, 2013"
7,"Disclosure:  I'm a big Sting fan.  Almost all of his albums either resonate or challenge me.  The guy is a master musician and very sophisticated song writer.   That said, this album doesn't work for me.   He's telling a story with a very clear point of view and probably shouldn't be viewed as an album as much as a musical soundtrack....which, in fact, it is.    But I'm afraid that Sting raised the bar too high to let Last Ship work for me.   The music is quite Celtic in lineage and if that doesn't float your boat, it may be the Last Ship to Sink.   The album almost sounds like a Van Morrison/Sting collaboration so if you like both artists, it may work for you.   It didn't work for me.  Sorry Gordon.

9,"Every now and then an album comes along that blows me away, it doesnt happen all that often anymore but it does still happen and The Graceless Age falls firmly into that category. I didnt really know much about John Murry before getting this record but I now feel I know him intimately and through this amazing album I can feel his pain, in the words of Bob Dylan there is definitely blood on the tracks along with sweat, tears and a whole host of other emotions. Right from the opener The Ballad of the Pajama Kid with its Pearl Jam meets Knocking on Heavens Door mash up you can just tell this is going to be a special record and there is no better example of his self-confessional approach as the ten minute Little Colored Balloons the sparse piano, cello and minimal gospel hues underpin the true story of Murrys heroin overdose, he was dead for several minutes before being revived. It has shades of Jason Spacemans confessionals on Ladies and Gentlemen We are Floating in Space but whereas he went grand with big sounds and production Murry is content with a stripped bare approach letting the sordid tale and his cracked and bruised vocal speak for itself. The innocent title refers to the way the drug was dispensed in his home town in coloured balloons. Guitars, strings and Hammond organ are often layered throughout punctuated by sounds clipped from police broadcasts, radio shows and television, distant voices are present but lost in the compositions perhaps reflecting how Murry felt in the world at the time when he was in the throes of his addictions. Lyrically it is deep and dark but musically it can sound like R.E.M., Jim White, Sparklehorse and in its more atmospheric sections not too dissimilar to Smog. In fact across the ten songs there probably wont be anything that will leap out as sounding all that new but its in the familiarity, warmth and clever construction that Murry can truly open up and take the listener on a journey into the darkest places a human can go and still survive. Like John Grants reinvention and subsequent rise on 2010 Queen of Denmark it is my hope that enough people find this album and make sure it hits the end of year lists as high as it deserves. Four years in the making this is a remarkable record that has real heart just note that the heart in question is pretty black.",0,0,"Jun  1, 2013"
10,"To me this is an album of 2012, but anyway, John Murry has made some of the best songs this decade. 'Little Colored Balloons' is one of the strongest songs I've ever heard, 'Southern Sky' is a masterpiece, 'Things We Lost In the Fire' presents the great singer/songwriter, and 'Thorn Tree In the Garden' shows he sure knows to pick his cover-songs.

7,"Billy Bragg returns with his 13th album and it some ways its a departure from his usual style but fans will instantly see the similarities to the work he did with Wilco on the Mermaid Avenue records. Tooth & Nail is perhaps the album that Bragg has always wanted to make, gone are the very British tales of kitchen sink dramas replaced by Americana stories of love, desolation and the downtrodden. A keen exponent and lover of all things Woody Guthrie, a version of I Ain't Got No Home is included here, Bragg wears his influences with pride and with his impressive backing band and Grammy award winning producer Joe Henry at the helm he has crafted an album in the very tradition of old time country/folk/blues. Stripped back and earthy Bragg has added an American tinge to his London drawl something which may irk some but in context of the album kind of fits. Slide guitar is present in most of the twelve tracks as is shuffled drums and a honky tonk pace. There Will Be A Reckoning may lack the kick that a younger Bragg would have given it but it proves that even after all this time he is prepared to get political and has not forgotten his ethics. lyrically we get the humble love song Handyman Blues but Bragg is not afraid to also tackle larger issues with references to the Higgs Boson in No One Knows Nothing Anymore and biblical origins of right and wrong in Do Unto Others while Your Name On My Tongue recalls Must I Paint You a Picture from Workers Playtime. Tooth & Nail is Bragg doing what he does best, its a mature record and a natural progression, Back to Basics this is not and nor should it be. The major negative point of most reviews seems to be the relocation of his style stateside but to that I say Bragg is a national treasure and we should all allow him the indulgence of crafting an album that is quintessentially Bragg without necessarily being quintessentially British, which is what he has done.",1,1,"Jun  1, 2013"

9,"Once I Was An Eagle is the fourth album from Laura Marling and with producer Ethan Johns they have created a masterpiece. Shy in her live performances on record this English rose turns the spotlight on herself and opens up in a way that is both honest and brave. The album, split into two sections by an interlude, is a stripped back affair, just guitar and cello with the occasional flurry of drums or keys allowing the listener easier access to Marlings exquisite voice and confessional lyrics. The opening suite of seven songs manage to blend almost seamlessly and yet amazingly retain their individuality. Guitar motifs crop up throughout as Marling sings of loss, heartbreak and naivety and it is in this first section that all the comparisons to Joni Mitchell will be made. But there are also traces of Dylan especially in the Master Hunter with its Tangled Up In Blue/It Aint Me Babe hybrid. The second half of the record is closer to her previous work and has more elements of Dylan but also nods to The Band, Velvet Underground, acoustic Zepplin and Aimee Mann. It is less raw than the first half but only just and the songs are slightly more fleshed out with instruments but the quality remains the same. Marling has the ability in her voice to range from angelic highs to whiskey soaked rasps that add real dynamics to these tales of relationships gone awry. But I think the most striking thing here is how mature the content and the song writing are, let us not forget that Marling is only 23. With an album this good its hard to know how she will ever be able to top it but for now we can just savour her Blood On The Tracks.",3,3,"Jun  1, 2013"

She has always sounded like an old soul in a young body (she's only 23), but with this record she skillfully balances wisdom with reckless abandon.

Marling and her guitar are back again, and like drips of water steadily becoming a stream, Take The Night Off begins. Marling's voice is more enchanting than ever (long gone is the slightly irritating estuary English from parts of Alas, I Cannot Swim) The easy, soothing introduction to Eaglemakes way for frenetic percussion and rising and falling guitar chords, reflective of Ms. Marling's new found avian alter-ego. The first four songs interlink, in the style of an Indian Raga, twisting a turning, changing shape and form, as Marling's liquid voice releases lyrical gem after lyrical gem.
It's true, as many reviewers have stated, that the first half of the album (Take The Night Off to Devil's Resting Place) is more united thematically than the second. However, it's in the second half that you realise that Marling must have some Well of the Muses stored in her garden, because she draws from so many emotions and viewpoints. Delicate strands and ideas all pulling together, bringing Eagleinto a second dimension.
She has clear influences, yes. Something most reviewers mention, and she's been called a 'third-rate Joni Mitchell' by one reviewer, but it's not where she draws from, it's where she takes them to. Master Hunter clearly alludes to Tangled Up In Blue, Bob Dylan's ode to love. Little Bird has bossa nova influences from time to time, and Undine has Blue Grass touches with it's lilting guitar mastery. However, the lyrics transcend her forbears, and the melody rises to the occasion. A masterpiece.",3,6,"May 28, 2013"
7,"'Once I was an Eagle' seems to be a somewhat aftermath of Marling's previous effort 'A Creature I Don't Know' (an album which has grown to be one of my favourites, not just by her). The overall production and style is reminiscent of her third album, but with a noticeably more minimal approach, notably in the first half of the album. The opening four tracks merge seamlessly together to create a 16 minute soundscape centred on her and her guitar, and this continues...throughout the whole album, with sparse instrumentation which continues and continues, in fact, this does not change until the 10th track 'Where Can I Go?' where we are introduced to a light drumkit and pretty organ.
Her lyrics on the other hand never cease to impress me, the way she takes characters form her own life and her own thoughts and reflects all these in her songs is unique to her and shows her influences from the folk greats. Her ongoing maturity as a songwriter is evident in this album, contrasted with her debut album 'Alas I Cannot Swim'. Not only her lyrics, but her voice has also grown up with the music she produces, and the way she presents her person through the microphone could not have been any different for this album.
The low point of the album for me is definitely 'Little Love Caster'; this seems to be a very tedious and almost self indulgent noddle on the guitar, strongly reminiscent of the previous album's track 'Night After Night'. Despite the interesting musical ideas and lyrics, the natural sound effects seem to be an overly pushed gimmick in my opinion.
My favourite track is definitely 'Where Can I Go?', where she explores the lyrical theme that suits her best, harkening to her younger past and acknowledging a 'curse' and constantly addressing the listener. The guitar plays few chords and is backed up by a beautiful organ part which swells along with the song to the end, but doesn't build to a climax.
I believe several tracks like 'Once' and 'Master Hunter' save this album from being a lackluster affair of banality, but it's the contrast between the near humdrum of tracks like 'You Know' and 'Devil's Resting Place' (seems more than just a reprise of 'Master Hunter') and these more interesting, adventurous songs that make this album the intriguing piece of art that it is, showing Marling's diverse guitar playing, captivating lyrics and her massively developed sound  credit to Ethan Johns in the progression from Charlie Fink's stuck-in-the-world-of-just-folk production.",0,2,"Jul 14, 2013"
7,"I enjoyed the album. The lyrics are mature, her voice and singing is great to listen to, and the music is serene. The production is also appreciated. I specifically liked how the first half felt like one big track, as every end of a song had the same music of the next one's beginning.
However, i'm not sure if i'll be remembering any of this by the end of the year. While it's pretty good, i can't consider it a 'masterful work' like some seem to call it.",0,0,"Jan 26, 2014"
9,"The only artist whose progress from a precocious 17-yr old to a mature 23-yr old, I have followed fervently. And yet again, she doesn't disappoint. 'Once I was an Eagle', is a progressively more mature and an elaborate album from this virtuous folk musician. This album for once and for all corroborates, the parallels drawn by critics to- Joni Mitchell and Bob Dylan.
For this album she teamed up with Producer/Percussionist Ethan Johns and cellist Ruth De Tuberville, the trio have a characteristic dark intimacy that perfectly compliments the songs that are acerbic and emotional.
The first 7 songs form the first part of the album, are segued together as each song morphs into another and are impossible to pick apart. The profundity of her very cogitative lyrics, that first catapulted her to fame, is even stronger on this one. In the title song 'I was an Eagle' she draws an analogy of an eagle as herself and dove as her hapless lover, which establishes her as a very clever poet. With each song the metaphorical analysis of her waning romance immerses the listener so deep as he/she is bound to tag along into a surreal journey of empathetic catharsis. We can also see her guitar playing prowess in 'Little Love Caster'.
The second part of the album starts with an interlude, where you again see the wonderful trinity of the three immensely talented musicians. Then what follows is another spell of brilliance, with songs like 'Where can I go?' and 'Once', completely taking over the listener and is bound to draw in more easy-listening fans, thanks to its beguiling tune and Marling's distinctive speak-singing.
This album is redolent of her imperious character, as a person, with songs like 'Master Hunter' substantiating that hypothesis. Some may argue of intrinsic androgynous element in the album, but I for one, don't really find it so, as she is just asserting her stand on things. I also find critics all over, drawing out correspondence of the album to her past lovers, I feel that it is a direct encroachment on her privacy, because let's be clear here, she is a poet (yes she is) and personally speaking, contrary to popular belief, very rarely real-life experiences give rise to poetry or in this case lyrics, her maturity in every album remains a testimony to that.
Let's face it, yet again, her brilliance will go unnoticed as she can never stoop down to the 'POP' (Programming pun here) level. But with 4 impressive albums at this young age, she is going to be a legend, not implying she isn't already, but I am talking of being in the ranks of Bob Dylan and Joni Mitchell.",0,0,"Nov 19, 2013"

9,"A big album. A bit too long for so heavy musics... Anyway, Laura Marling made her best work in Once I Was an Eagle. The first four songs introduce the person in her aura, which is softened after the Intelude and broken in the last song. One of the best albuns of 2013",0,0,"Jan 17, 2014"
10,"It's hard to imagine a more blissful combination of pain and paradise than hearing Patty Griffin on this stripped down, heart-broken-open recording.  MASTERPIECE!",2,2,"May  9, 2013"
10,"I have long wondered why Patty Griffin isn't more well known if not downright revered for her art.  American Kid makes that gap between her achievements and notoriety seem even stranger.  She has put forth collections of perfectly sculpted songs for years, too many masterpieces to recount at this point.  American Kid is her finest accomplishment to date.  American Kid is not the same sort of collection of miniatures Griffin typically releases.  It's unified by theme in a way her other albums have not been, save Downtown Church.  It's a whole, fully formed work.  Nothing she has ever done has felt more personal, and that is saying a lot, considering her distinctive ability to hit the heart and soul with that one of a kind combination of singing and songwriting.  The people in these songs, veterans, slaves, lovers, sons, God himself, fathers, especially her own, walk in to the room during these songs--her word choices are that perfect and evocative in each turn of lyric and note.  This album also seems to carry with it the weight of American history, the history experienced by men like her father, men now leaving the earth, people long past and forgotten.  Anyone who has known these men or who has lost someone they love or seen a love end too soon will cherish this album.  Patty seems determined in these songs to commit their stories (most poignantly her father's story) to memory for all time.  American Kid is a stunning achievement.  A masterwork by one of our great living singer/songwriters.  No one who still values the craft of song-making and songwriting should leave this album out of their collection.",1,1,"May  9, 2013"
9,"Stunning album, and the best I have heard this year. Patty Griffin has always amazed me with her storytelling and musical ability, and this album is probably the best collection of focused songs that she has released. Wild old dog, go wherever you wanna go, that kind of lonely, and not a bad man are among immediate standouts, but the album flows wonderfully and is full of excellent lyrics, great music, and diverse production. I think you will struggle to find a more touching and beautiful album this year. Excellent.",1,1,"May  9, 2013"
10,"I've run out of words to describe the greatness of Patty Griffin. If she's ever written a bad song, it hasn't been recorded. She's a genius at conveying the details of simple moments to immerse you in the story, to make you feel like you've been somewhere you've never been. She's not just a great poet, she's an insightful voice. American Kid is a masterpiece and sonically is quite different than her other albums. Listen to the first 4 tracks and tell me she isn't the best songwriter alive today.",1,1,"May  9, 2013"
10,"Griffin should be much better known than she is, but then mediocrity often rises to the top. American Kid is a spellbinding masterpiece, a word which I don't apply indiscriminately. It's her Blood on the Tracks.",0,0,"May 13, 2013"
5,"I thought Shinju was pretty lack-luster but at least on that they were still bein crazy and trying new things. This album plays it way too safe for them and suffers because of it. It's boring and the melodies aren't that intriguing. None of the songs even throw you for a loop with an interesting change partway through. This band used to be my favorite but it seems like they are just digging a hole at this point. Only good song is 'In the Morning' which I should mention could have been a great song but they never push it to that next level and pretty much just let it repeat.",0,1,"May  5, 2013"
8,"A fan only from their 2009 release, the eccentric sound of Akron/Family captured me with their upbeat grooves which married an ability to create, for a lack of a better word, 'epic' noise. Although coming from a (personally) disappointing 2011 release, 'Sub Verses' still carries a bit of the moving groove but in a shift, matures toward a completely different tangent. Lots of noise and sound, part of what makes it an incredible album.",0,0,"May 24, 2013"

9,"Getting back to her roots, Iris Dement's first album of original music in 16 years is a triumphant return. Her songs of heartbreak, love, family, and religion are steeped in her childhood in the Arkansas Delta. Her songwriting is so personal and powerful you often need to listen to songs multiple times to fully appreciate their depth. Her voice may not be for everyone but is is perfect for the songs that she writes. Listening to Iris sing you will be moved. All I can say is that I hope that I don't have to wait another 16 years for the next album of her songwriting.",0,0,"Dec 30, 2015"
10,"This album is definitely more polished than the first. Babel stands up well to Sigh No More with no less than 8 great tracks. 'Lovers' Eyes' and 'Hopeless Wanderer' being good enough to rival 'The Cave' and 'Little Lion Man'. Pick up this album and you won't be disappointed!",2,2,"Sep 29, 2012"
10,"Excellent album!  Thought it would be hard to top their breakout album Sigh No More but this one comes real close.  Amazing sophmore release.  I haven't stopped listening to it since I received it two weeks ago.  Solid from beginning to end.

9,"Huge mumford and sons fan! I give it a nine, I would give it a ten but it seems to be lacking in some songs.  Lyrics are great because they actually mean something.  Those that judge it based on lyrics because they like rappers and other, in my mind, music with no meaning just talking about smoking and drinking should probably not even review a band like mumford and sons because it is a totally different form of musical quality and meaning.  Not upset at all with this album but I can see why some people are, maybe mumford and sons isn't for you.  But to me its relaxing and refreshing and has a powerful lyrics, don't expect anything different from a full hearted band like mumford and sons. One word, Amazing!",2,2,"Oct 26, 2012"

The songwriting was wonderful, every song was a joy to listen to...from a music standpoint. My only problem here are the lyrics. Especially in the title track the lyrics were repetitive and un-entertaining. Other than that, the album was a fun and exhilarating ride. This was a very worthy follow up to the wonderful 'Sigh No More' which was also great fun. Great stuff, thanks to Mumford & Sons! 8/10.",2,2,"Dec 15, 2012"
10,"If it's possible to be better than perfect, then this certainly is as it's better than Sigh No More.

8,"The amount of criticism this album has received seems completely unfair while i agree the band could have aimed for something new its only their second album and when reviewed on its own merits i fail to see the problem.
Babel is a good album with catchy songs in keeping with their folk-rock style that's appealing to a wide range of audiences.",2,2,"Jun 26, 2013"

7,"It's a very 'if it aint broke, don't fix it album'. Mumford sticks to the strengths that made them an international success with Sigh No More.  Babel has an 'arena-folk' type feel to it with a few very catchy tunes.  The songs range from darker biblical inspired themes to catchy and fun stomp-your-feet-to-the-beat tunes. If your a fan of Mumford and Sons this is a good buy. If your not a fan of Mumford and Sons well that is your right and no judgement is passed on you by me.",1,1,"Nov  4, 2012"
9,"Firstly it has to be said that it's a less 'organic' sounding album. It's much more produced. Now if you don't like that, you obviously will think less of this than of 'Sigh No More'  which is the general opinion.
That said, I disagree completely. It's a better album than 'Sigh No More'.
It's easy to pass to this off as 'all sounding the same', which of course you'll see in a lot of reviews. But that's an overstatement, oversimplified even.  For one, you'll find than in most bands people tend to play the same instruments.. I know, shocker -we'll just ignore Mumford & Sons multi-instrumentalist members for a moment. But most of all most songs aren't even all that similar to one another. You can take one song and compare to another, maybe 2. And so on. But that can be done with every album. It's what comes with playing in a certain style.
There's a lot of build-ups, yes -I'll refer to them as 'Big Climaxes'. Build-ups being a very key factors of music, I'm surprised so people find it negative. They're well done & well produced. They sound great! How can you not love the moment where Below My Feet breaks open, fully anthemic!
I Will Wait & Holland Road are probably the most (actually/genuinely) similar songs on the album -pretty much like Little Lion Man & White Black Page we're on 'Sigh No More'. Both move towards that 'Big Climax'. Both are very warm sounding songs.. and both are 2 very good songs! Holland Road being the better in my opinion.
Babel can be added those the other to as being very similar, but I'm not a big fan of Babel; the song.
Ghosts That We Knew is more subdued song, and pretty one at that. It's very gentle & only gets marginally bigger as the song progresses. It's not as soft & sweet Reminder, one of the highlights of the album, though.
Now Whispers in the Dark, Lover of the Light & Lover's Eyes can pretty much be paired together. All 3 are pretty bright songs. They're not my favorites, but good songs not the less.
Hopeless Wanderer & Broken Crown are two of the darker songs (compare them to I Gave You All and Thistle & Weeds) and are 2 of the best songs on the album. Broken Crown is some of the best songwriting on the album -maybe THE best-  despite the misfire that is 'I f*cked it all away'. Hopeless Wanderer starts with a  piano part that has a sense of yearning, which makes up the verse, with some added accompaniment. The chorus goes into full on acoustic rock & a rhythm change that tends to catch you off guard. This ones 'Big Climax' does not sound as warm & open as other songs on the record though.  It sounds more shrill & edgy.
Below My Feet is the 'Arena Anthem'. It's a favorite of mine.
Not With Haste is a slower song, comparable to Ghosts That We Knew in that aspect.. but different. Yearning rather than nostalgic & soaring rather than subdued, but never the point of the 'Big Climax'. Far from it.
The same can be said about For Those Below -it being slower. It has a very different melodic-style than anything else Mumford & Sons. It's probably my least favorite song on the (Deluxe Edition) album though.
The cover of The Boxer is a very good one. Collaborating with Paul Simon himself & Jerry Douglas, a resonator & pedal steel-guitarist. It's as said a very good cover, great production, great harmonies & some great leads of Jerry Douglas.
Where Are You Now. Another slowed down song, most akin to Ghosts That We Knew. It never gets big, with very subdued strumming & warm sounding guitar(s). It's lamenting & it's beautiful. A great song to end the (Deluxe Edition) album.
In the end (of this long review), I'll can only repeat. It's sound is more(/better) produced, rather than the more organic sound of 'Sigh No More'. But it genuinely is a better album. It's bigger, warmer, it has the a festival vibe, just like 'Sigh No More' had.. And there's really no better album to listen to on nice sunny days. The feel is perfect for that.",1,1,"Sep 21, 2013"

8,"Babel is, unfortunately, worse than Sigh no More. But that doesnt make it bad in any way. Its, from a critical standpoint, a solid album. Its BIG difference from Sigh No More is that Babel is really forgettable (in the sense that it isnt really catchy as its predecessor) and can very oftenly get boring. Songs are kinda same sounding and dont seem as diverse in melody as the first album. In this regard, the album is bordering poor.
However, the positives outshine the negatives in Babel. Lyrically, its a 10 out of 10. As always the band puts together amazing poetry to the songs. The first one depended heavily on influence by Shakespears writing, as well as quoting from the bible a couple of times. Babel improves on this, shaking off the dependence and making great lyrics from scratch. Song structure is also improved, changing up the verse-chorus-verse-chorus-bridge-chorus structure which was EVERYWHERE in Sigh No More. Babel is much more varied in that sense. Production is also a bit 'cleaner' than in Sigh No More. If this is positive or negative depends on the listener.
All in all, while Id give Sigh No More a 9.1, Babel is more of a 7.7 (8 here in Metacritic, I guess). But while Sigh No More could be listened several times, Babel I doubt I personally will hear much more. It is critically good, but isnt really memorable. Maybe itll grow on me later, but for now, its kind of a disappointment.",3,4,"Sep 26, 2012"

From the first track, Babel, to the last, Not with Haste, the sounds evolve, change, and end with a completely satisfied idea. The variation really shows the maturation of this band and the flawless execution of this album should leave everyone excited for not only the things to come, but the fact that we a witnessing a very special band.",3,4,"Sep 27, 2012"

For lovers of their first hit album Bable will continue to impress, yet it feels like the boys of Mumford and Sons haven",3,4,"Sep 27, 2012"
6,"First, I have to say that this is not a bad album, at all.  In fact, the lyrics are great, the rythms catchy and the vocals are amazing.  That being said, I'm a tad disappointed in this record.  I knew the band would not change their style (and I would not want that by any means), but my opinion is that there is such a redundancy in the songs, that not only do I feel like almost all the tracks sound the same, it also feels like it could be 'Sigh no more - part 2'.  I LOVED Sigh no more, so that's not the issue, but I wish they'd have explored, or innovate their potential.  In fact, I feel as if after their success with their first album, they were aiming more radio-time, more exposure (I can't criticize them for that, though), which lead to somewhat catchy, less original songs... less M&S, to be short.  I do think the songs, individually, are good.  The issue is when you listen to the whole album, it feels repetitive.  After listening to the record, I only felt like putting 'Sigh no more' back on my turntable... Sadly, I expected more of their second album, especially since I loved their first one so much.  All in all, this is a good album, great songs, great vocals and intrumental bits, BUT it feels like an arena-based album, less original, more catchy, more encline to meet everyone's tastes.  I love this band, so I really wish they don't become another not-so original indie band losing their originality to fit the radio mold.  Still, I'm not disappointed I bought the vinyl: good album, just not up to expectations!",3,4,"Dec 18, 2012"
9,"This is such a refreshing album! After hearing some of the complaints of this album it's like people didn't know what to expect from this band! They are a folk-rock band, why are people surprised that they released an album that has drawn so much reference and style from other folk bands! It is a mixture of powerful and heavy set songs that make you want to just move, and some amazingly heartfelt ballads. It is not quite the perfect album that 'Sigh No More' was but it I would happily listen to this over the mediocrity of modern music, the senseless and endless drones that you hear on the radio (Guetta, Skrillex, Rita Ora et al)
Each song has a different meaning to the last and as a complete album the deluxe version is simply beautiful!",6,9,"Sep 27, 2012"

I understand it doesn't have tracks like 'Sign No More', 'The Cave' or 'Little Lion Man,' but it also doesn't have songs that are skip worthy (such as 'Dustbowl Dance'). On top of that, 'Below My Feet' may be one of their best tracks yet. Yeah, it all kind of sounds the same but that's the Mumford we've come to know and love, there are a few new elements to make this a great album.",2,3,"Sep 26, 2012"
8,"Yes, they made a great album and i'm glad that the public recognize it and the perfect first week sales are reflecting the hard work to make this album named 'Babel'. Favourite tracks: Babel, Hopeless Wanderer, The Boxer and Lover's Eyes. Buy this on iTunes, worth so much !",2,3,"Oct  6, 2012"
4,"Repetitive. When I heard the title track, I was excited. It kept me juiced for three minutes, and it became horridly boring. It becomes unbearable to listen to after I Will Wait, and extremely forgettable while it's at it. Though the album has good songs, as a whole it was unsatisfying.",2,3,"Mar 14, 2014"
10,"They've taken what made them unique and good before, and polished it to such a fine sheen that you can hear your own soul in their music. This is the best thing that's happened to the modern music scene in quite a while. I wasn't a fan of their earlier music, even though I liked it somewhat, but I just can't get over this album. Lyrically profound, dynamically perfect and played with such energy and conviction you just can't help wanting to sing along.

6,"I absolutely LOVE their debut Sigh No More.  One of my favorite popular albums of 2009.  Despite this however, I detected some hints of redundancy structurally on it, which I hoped they'd fix on their sophomore album.  Spoiler alert: THEY DIDN'T!  Now you'd think I, as a Mumford & Sons fan, would be thrilled that they'd release an album that sounds exactly like their debut.  But that's not how I listen to music.  I want bands to develop.  I want bands to evolve.  I want bands to experiment stylistically.  Or if they don't, they should at least keep their sound interesting.  Sadly, none of this happens.  Instead we get a watered-down, boring, predictable & rehashed version of their debut without nearly as many memorable melodies & lyrics.  Even when they did this repetitive formula on Sigh No More, they at least either gave songs different emotional vibes or (to some extent) different musical styles, or at least made them catchy enough that I wouldn't mind.  Here, it's nearly all the same, but this time with a slight hint of overproduction that makes a lot of the instruments just bleed together a lot of the time.  There's only a few songs here where something actually sticks in your head or makes any real impact.  The rest of the time it's somewhat poetic yet predictable lyrics with themes we've already heard over & over on previous Mumford & Sons songs (HE SAYS THE WORD 'HEART' IN 9/12 OF THE SONGS ON THE STANDARD EDITION!) combined with forgettable instrumentation & melodies that rarely even try to be catchy, but when they do it's not nearly enough to save it from mediocrity.  And even sometimes when the melodies themselves are good, they don't get good until the structure they've confined themselves in will allow it to be good.  Sometimes it doesn't get good until the loud part, or sometimes it stops being good at the loud part.  Heck, Reminder is the only song here that stays in one mode, and it's absolutely gorgeous!  The bonus tracks For Those Below & Where Are You Now also deviate a little, and they'd be very refreshing to hear on the standard edition.  And holy crap, can Winston please play more than one banjo picking pattern?!  It's the same one on every song!  Now if there's one thing I can say is a constant positive throughout Babel, it's that Marcus' vocals most of the time have a lot of passion & sincerity, which makes it even more sad that he insists on using them on these bland tracks  There were even times when I wished I could've been there at the recording sessions to tell him to sing a particular melody in a slightly different way to make it better.  Bottom line: okay album but it's very fair to say they've stagnated big-time with this one.  Please, Mumford & Sons, try something different next time.  Doesn't have to be a complete stylistic transformation but still, do something more interesting than this.  The 'dramatic buildup' gimmick is getting old.  Favorite tracks (in order): I Will Wait, Reminder, Babel, Hopeless Wanderer, Lover of the Light, For Those Below (bonus track), Broken Crown, Holland Road.  Least favorite tracks: All the other ones.  None are really 'bad' though.  Just boring, even if they're notable lyrically (i.e. Ghosts That We Knew & Not With Haste).  Overall score: 62/100",1,3,"Nov 24, 2012"
5,"I really liked their debut, but this is just a boring instauration from 'Sigh No More'. Instead of rememberable rhythms and interesting lyrics, almost every song on 'Babel' sounds the same. You have to have really low expectations to be not disappointed with this release. Their single 'I Will Wait' is the only really good song in here, the rest is pretty poor. But I'll give an extra point because of their style, which is nice. I like them but this album is nothing. It's really boring and so are the lyrics. They don't tell anything! However, it's not that bad, but you won't miss anything if you don't listen to 'Babel'.",1,3,"Nov 11, 2012"
1,"I know dat fool da shrimp be loving this album........but imo they are very fake as a band and their lyrics are at an elementary school's intro to poetry class level.  Many people becuase of when they both rose in popularity compare these guys to The Avett Brothers.  That to me is a joke.  Avetts are better in about every way but lets just start with more complex lyrics with true meaning and understanding.  M&S are no different to Americana Folk music as Coldplay is to top 40.  Both are fakes who are not near as original or talented as the zombie like media following both have would lead you to believe.  Word.",3,15,"Sep 26, 2012"

6,"Mumford & Sons are one of the best folk bands on earth and this album is interesting and good to listen. However I noticed that some songs have almost the same instrumental performance.
I think that they should be more original with the instrumental aspect because with the voice the band has no problems. I really like Marcus Mumford's voice! The instrumental part is essential in every song and if they start to be uninteresting about it some new folk artists that are appearing now in the industry can become better and most succeeded",0,2,"Mar 22, 2013"

7,"Mumford & Sons follow up their very decent debut with more of the same. While the album isn't bad at all, the biggest complaint is that it doesn't really build on what has gone before, dishing up a very similar formula to the one which proved so successful on their debut. If this was their debut, I reckon people would be admiring it to an extent but unfortunately it's not. The saying 'If it aint broke don't fix it' isn't really applicable when it comes to music and art in general. I wouldn't go as far as to say the band knocked this album out for the money  but I can equally understand why people level that criticism at them.

7,"I loved 'Sigh No More'. It was a great album with some great music. That's why I was looking forward to listen to their next studio effort, 'Babel'. Honestly, it sounds just like their previous album. It's just that this one has more songs. There just isn't much difference in the instrumentals. (That obviously means that they're consistent with their music, which is very good.) If I had heard of Mumford & Sons for the first time because of THIS album, I would have definitely liked it more. The fact is, I've heard all this before, on their debut, 'Sigh No More'.
The reason I'm giving this a 7 is because I like this genre of music, and it's a good album on its own.

6,"After their excellent debut, folk rock favourites Mumford and Sons released ''Babel''.
I had high expectations for this album, but found myself ultimately a little disappointed. Things start fairly well, with the thumping and lively title track, followed up by the rich and promising ''Whispers in the Dark''. The band's first single from the album, ''I will wait'', comes next and easily proves to be the highlight of the album, with it's constant tempo changes and melodies that build into a moving and raucous chorus.
After that though, things go gradually downhill. While it can't exactly be said that many of the tracks on this album provide poor listening (in fact, musically most are pretty accomplished), in terms of lyrical themes and construction they are generally below par and repetitive.
Though songs such as ''The ghosts that we knew'', ''Broken Crown'' and ''Hopeless Wanderer'' are aesthetically very decent tunes, in terms of general construction and lyrical content, it's as though they are re-hashed and poor relations of songs that appeared on debut album ''Sigh No More''. What's even more of a shame is that the band seem to have taken the easy ''well we were successful with it before, so why not re-hash it and release it again'' option, rather than being more brave.
Perhaps the finest piece of songwriting on the album comes in the shape of ''Constant Reminder'', a beautiful, immensely sad and powerful acoustic track; Well thought out, both in terms of lyrics and music. The Mumford's could perhaps have delivered something a little more memorable and longer lasting in memory if they'd have put their minds to it.",0,0,"Nov 13, 2015"

9,"Every now and then an album comes along that blows me away, it doesnt happen all that often anymore but it does still happen and The Graceless Age falls firmly into that category. I didnt really know much about John Murry before getting this record but I now feel I know him intimately and through this amazing album I can feel his pain, in the words of Bob Dylan there is definitely blood on the tracks along with sweat, tears and a whole host of other emotions. Right from the opener The Ballad of the Pajama Kid with its Pearl Jam meets Knocking on Heavens Door mash up you can just tell this is going to be a special record and there is no better example of his self-confessional approach as the ten minute Little Colored Balloons the sparse piano, cello and minimal gospel hues underpin the true story of Murrys heroin overdose, he was dead for several minutes before being revived. It has shades of Jason Spacemans confessionals on Ladies and Gentlemen We are Floating in Space but whereas he went grand with big sounds and production Murry is content with a stripped bare approach letting the sordid tale and his cracked and bruised vocal speak for itself. The innocent title refers to the way the drug was dispensed in his home town in coloured balloons. Guitars, strings and Hammond organ are often layered throughout punctuated by sounds clipped from police broadcasts, radio shows and television, distant voices are present but lost in the compositions perhaps reflecting how Murry felt in the world at the time when he was in the throes of his addictions. Lyrically it is deep and dark but musically it can sound like R.E.M., Jim White, Sparklehorse and in its more atmospheric sections not too dissimilar to Smog. In fact across the ten songs there probably wont be anything that will leap out as sounding all that new but its in the familiarity, warmth and clever construction that Murry can truly open up and take the listener on a journey into the darkest places a human can go and still survive. Like John Grants reinvention and subsequent rise on 2010 Queen of Denmark it is my hope that enough people find this album and make sure it hits the end of year lists as high as it deserves. Four years in the making this is a remarkable record that has real heart just note that the heart in question is pretty black.",0,0,"Jun  1, 2013"
10,"To me this is an album of 2012, but anyway, John Murry has made some of the best songs this decade.

Beautiful.",10,10,"Sep 11, 2012"
10,"Best Bob Dylan's effort in years. Bob remains as the truest storyteller in recent years and he is still on top of his game both lyrically and musically. Every track on this thing is a killer. Not a single word or chord is meaningless or out of touch. Instant classic and an essential album at the beginning of this decade.",5,5,"Sep 11, 2012"
9,"The title track is one of the most haunting pieces of music to be written in years. Bob is beyond brilliant. This album is just shy of a perfect score for me, but I am sure many will consider it to be flawless. 'Roll On John' is another personal favorite from the album.",2,2,"Sep 11, 2012"
10,"My opinion is that this is the best Bob Dylan album since Time Out of Mind and in some ways I like it even more than that.  Grew on me rather well with the first 7 or 8 listens.  Lots of highlights.  So many that the album itself is a magnificent highlight and it's the best thing I have heard so far this year, by far.  I also think it's one of Dylan's strongest efforts ever that has paid off in big dividends.  High praise for great work here.",2,2,"Sep 11, 2012"
9,"Tempest won't convert anyone who hasn't enjoyed Love and Theft or Modern Times but it's Dylan's best album in years. Great songwriting, the best band Dylan has had since The Band and, surprisingly given his past aversion to recording studios, Dylan's self-production is superb, crystal clear with his ravaged voice to the fore. Fantastic stuff. I suspect Nick Cave or Bonnie Prince Billy would've been happy to put their names to some some of these dark tales.",1,1,"Sep 11, 2012"
10,"So here we have it, what could possibly be Bob Dylan's final album. What can be said that hasn't already been said? This is his, in my personal opinion, his finest album since 1997's Time Out Of Mind. What I may say is that the album does feel more than the sum of its parts. Not all songs are fantastic with the lowest points being Roll On John and Soon After Midnight. While these songs are forgettable, they are by no means bad in any way with Roll On John being a sweet tribute to his old musical colleague John Lennon. Meanwhile highlights include the freewheelin ' style of Duquesne Whistle, the hypnotic Tin Angel and the epic 14 minute and 45 verse long title track. The most interesting aspect of the album is, as always with Bob Dylan, the lyrics. The imagery on this album is among the most vivid of his 50 year career with Tempest (the song) giving such a full picture that it is comparable to watching a film. And in the end of this song, the only one who remains is the watchman, lonely and pondering over events passed. One can only imagine that this is a metaphor for Dylan who stands alone in American music giving us his unique take on the world and still as ever, deep in his thoughts.",1,1,"Sep 12, 2012"
10,"Amazing album, especially for a 71 year old. But as Dylan ages, the quality and power of his music does not, and Tempest sees Dylan at top form with great new songs. The band is tight, and the music is much better rehearsed than Together Through Life and Christmas In The Heart. Also, Dylan's voice is clear and strong in the album, and is as emotive as always!",1,1,"Nov 21, 2012"
4,"Much acclaimed by the critics and topping the charts all over the world, I was expecting a lot of Bob Dylan's latest work. 'Tempest' has only got 10 songs, but lasts more than one hour as a whole. The thing he's doing here is versifying, actually. All of this 8 minute songs or so tell a long story, which is underlined with relaxing music. The problem is: the main riff stays the same in virtually all songs and that's bothersome. Musically it's relatively poor but the lyrics are pretty well, 'Tin Angel' has the very best, I opine.
All in all, 'Tempest' is average, additionally getting a minus point because of his voice, which got worse and worse over the years.",0,4,"Sep 27, 2012"

8,"Unbeliebably the master of song writing is still producing the goods more than half a century after he started out. It's one thing to be still recording at this stage in his career, but to be producing works of such high quality is really incredible. Everything that's needs to be said about Dylan has been said before so won't bang on about his legendary status but his his latest offering, Tempest follows the rich vein of form that saw Dylan produce 'Love  Theft' and 'Modern Times'. If you liked those records then your in for a treat. All the songs are between 7 and 9 out of 10 and there is a remarkable consistency throughout the record. Different songs stand out on different listens so it's hard to pick favourites. The title track, detailing the final hours of the Titanic, runs on for the best part of 14 minutes  a bit much you may think, but if you know Dylan, you'll know that some of his best work is also is lengthiest. Roll On John closes the record in fitting manner, a tip of the cap to John Lennon. This will delight existing fans and perhaps may attract a few open minded people who've not yet discovered this genius.",0,0,"Mar  1, 2013"

7,"Billy Bragg returns with his 13th album and it some ways its a departure from his usual style but fans will instantly see the similarities to the work he did with Wilco on the Mermaid Avenue records. Tooth & Nail is perhaps the album that Bragg has always wanted to make, gone are the very British tales of kitchen sink dramas replaced by Americana stories of love, desolation and the downtrodden. A keen exponent and lover of all things Woody Guthrie, a version of I Ain't Got No Home is included here, Bragg wears his influences with pride and with his impressive backing band and Grammy award winning producer Joe Henry at the helm he has crafted an album in the very tradition of old time country/folk/blues. Stripped back and earthy Bragg has added an American tinge to his London drawl something which may irk some but in context of the album kind of fits. Slide guitar is present in most of the twelve tracks as is shuffled drums and a honky tonk pace. There Will Be A Reckoning may lack the kick that a younger Bragg would have given it but it proves that even after all this time he is prepared to get political and has not forgotten his ethics. lyrically we get the humble love song Handyman Blues but Bragg is not afraid to also tackle larger issues with references to the Higgs Boson in No One Knows Nothing Anymore and biblical origins of right and wrong in Do Unto Others while Your Name On My Tongue recalls Must I Paint You a Picture from Workers Playtime. Tooth & Nail is Bragg doing what he does best, its a mature record and a natural progression, Back to Basics this is not and nor should it be. The major negative point of most reviews seems to be the relocation of his style stateside but to that I say Bragg is a national treasure and we should all allow him the indulgence of crafting an album that is quintessentially Bragg without necessarily being quintessentially British, which is what he has done.",1,1,"Jun  1, 2013"

The best are old songs that have been around forever like Once and Future Carpenter,Down With the Shine,Pretty Girl From Michigan(Telling Time). Imo the best song they have ever written is Die Then Grow which it too has been around forever.  It surprisingly is a 'bonus track' only available at Target.  Good thing I got that one.  You can tell the brothers got married and had kids in the lyrics they wrote.  Paul Newman is my one complaint.  It never really works throughout the song and does not fit on this album imo.  February 7 and Life are great tunes.",1,1,"Sep 13, 2012"
6,"Over the last couple of years, the Avett Brothers have expanded their fan base substantially.  For those of us a fan of their earlier efforts, this album is too polished, poppy, and radio-friendly.  In fact, I think it is a decent album, but has none of the characteristics that made me a huge Avett Brothers fan in the first place.  Change and growth is great, but in this case I think they should not have chosen Rick Rubin to produce them.  He should stick to the Red Hot Chili Peppers and Linkin Park and not ruin great bands like the Avett Brothers.",1,1,"Sep 14, 2012"

4,"Their sound is polished, but that's not necessarily a good thing. I suppose I should have expected the album to have this pop-rock sound after I and Love and You, an album I ignored after the first listen other than about four of its tracks. The songs on The Carpenter feel safe and sterile; there's no raw energy, passion, or honest emotion that I loved about the Avetts in the past. The first two tracks are by far the best, but even Live and Die would be a weak effort on, say, Emotionalism. The rest are mostly sad, slow, and nostalgic, with lots of trite metaphors about seasons.",0,1,"Oct  3, 2012"
10,"The much anticipated new album from The Avett Brothers is finally here, and it was worth the wait. 'The Carpenter' is a combination of all of that is great about this band. Teaming up once again with Rick Rubin, this album proves that The Avett Brothers are here to stay. The title track 'The Once and Future Carpenter' plays like a life story, with poetic lyrics and a toe-tapping bluegrass beat. Their first release, 'Live and Die', pulls you in with the banjo and then makes you want to get up and swing your sweetheart around the room.
The smoky ballad 'Winter in my Heart' slows the pace a bit, but not the momentum of the beautiful lyrics and sweet vocals. There is such honesty in these songs that my heart aches a bit with each verse. 'They say seasons turn in time. Their's are changing; why won't mine.'
'Pretty Girl from Michigan' begins with the piano and then breaks into a bluegrass/rock anthem reminiscent of the late 50's and sock hops without being hokey and derivative. 'I Never Knew You' reminds me of The Beautiful South with the harmonies and slightly biting lyrics. It definitely put a smile on my face.
'Life' reminds us of the impermanence of life. The floating melodies are played with such grace on the guitar and backed by the violin. This song is best appreciated by closing your eyes, putting on your headphones and leaning your head back and giving in to it. 'Through My Prayers' brings to mind a lost love that was hard to give up. Regret and heartache make this one such a poignant song.
One song that brings a new sound to the group is 'Paul Newman vs. The Demons'. Less acoustic than most of their other songs with a more prominent drum beat and some latin electric guitar sounds, this song demonstrates the versatility of the band. They are not just a one trick pony.
As with their previous album, this one is going to be a favorite of mine. I highly recommend that you check it out along with the rest of their albums. You can download it now at iTunes at this link:

A differenza di altri che partono dalla stessa radice popolare per poi mischiare i generi o deviare bruscamente  vedi lirruenza dei Bellowhead o gli accenti che caratterizzano gli Admiral Fallow  Roberts rimane aderente agli stilemi pi tradizionali, intessendo i brani, tutti autografi, di richiami a melodie dei tempi che furono, indicando con diligenza i prestiti gi a partire dai titoli.

5,"Don't get me wrong: I absolutely love Regina Spektor. She is an amazing artist who I found one day and who I have been obsessed with ever since. I delved deeper into her older albums and found simply amazing music, pure and not clouded with unnecessary bells and whistles.
I love the songs on this album, but they all seem like filler songs. Not to mention 3 or 4 of these songs have already been on youtube for years, they're just redone with special sound effects. I had been looking forward to this album for years and it just fell short. The lyrics do seem much more shallow than they were in Far, Soviet Kitsch, and ESPECIALLY Begin to Hope. Some of them just didn't seem like Spektor at all! How isn't original at all, something I would never expect from my favorite musician. I hope she makes another album, but I also hope it's more spektor-tastic! I still have so much ReSpekt for her though :) She's still amazing! The album just sadly fell short :(",3,3,"Aug 19, 2012"

Since her first major album, Soviet Kitsch, was released in 2004, Spektor has entertained listeners not only with her impressively broad vocals but with beatboxing, dolphin noises, mesmerizing French and Russian lyrics, and many other interesting stylistic choices.  Her songs tell stories rather than list emotions (she told Rolling Stone in 2009 that",1,1,"May 31, 2012"
9,"Regina Spektor is one of those artists hardly anyone likes at first. Like liquor. She's a lyrically puzzling, piano thumping storytelling with vocal arrangements as dramatic as a theater major... but also much like liquor, once you really get into the music, it becomes an uncontrollable addiction. What We Saw From the Cheap Seats is like a delicious fruity drink with deadly amounts of mixed vodkas and gins. It will knock you on your ass when you're done with it. It's definitely Spektor's most down-to-Earth, calm album yet, with productions quality at an all-time high, but her identity as a humbly strange anti-folk legend remains.Spektor seems to be more aware of herself and her talents on this album, using more accents ('Oh Marcello'), beat boxing ('All The Rowboats') and hand-and-feet instrumentation ('Small Town Moon') than seen on any of her previous albums. She even steps out from behind the piano to play the trumpet in 'The Party,' with only her mouth and no trumpet of course.Before the album is even halfway over she gives us one of her most beautifully depressing ballads in years with 'Firewood,' which rivals Begin to Hope track 'Samson' both musically and vocally. A couple tracks later and again she ups the ante with 'How,' a song about heartbreak so jarring that it could make even Duffy or Adele seem as cheerful as Ke$ha. Still, Spektor isn't all about depressing hidden meanings and quirky, cutesy air instruments. She has, over the years, been uncovering a more pop side of herself that seems to shine on each album like 'Folding Chair' from Far or 'Better' from Begin to Hope. This album offers up 'The Party' which compares a swain to a lively parade that leaves you messily frazzled and smiling. 'Ballad of a Politician' is the most nostalgic record, reminiscent of tracks like 'Chemo Limo' that chronicle corruption, a favorite topic of mine. It's hard to put Spektor is to one category or another. Her music bounces from between different genres and themes. She's an explorer. An acquired taste, yes, but she definitely knows exactly who she is and what she wants her music to sound like. Now that she has a bigger budget and production team behind her, moreso than her first 5 albums, she can bring that huge imagination out of her head and into our ears.",1,1,"May 29, 2012"

This record takes a more poppy sound than its' predecessor 'Far' and despite being a bit darker, deceives the listener by fronting it with light, fluffy piano and brass section. Lead single 'All The Rowboats' is probably the standout track on the record, others are 'Small Town Moon' and 'The Party'.",0,0,"Jun  6, 2012"

The songs released around 2009 and 2010 sound a lot like Age of Adz; the earlier EPs on Songs for Christmas remind me of Seven Swans and Illinois.

7,"It's a very 'if it aint broke, don't fix it album'. Mumford sticks to the strengths that made them an international success with Sigh No More.

9,"Firstly it has to be said that it's a less 'organic' sounding album. It's much more produced. Now if you don't like that, you obviously will think less of this than of 'Sigh No More'  which is the general opinion.
That said, I disagree completely. It's a better album than 'Sigh No More'.
It's easy to pass to this off as 'all sounding the same', which of course you'll see in a lot of reviews. But that's an overstatement, oversimplified even.  For one, you'll find than in most bands people tend to play the same instruments.. I know, shocker -we'll just ignore Mumford & Sons multi-instrumentalist members for a moment. But most of all most songs aren't even all that similar to one another. You can take one song and compare to another, maybe 2. And so on. But that can be done with every album. It's what comes with playing in a certain style.
There's a lot of build-ups, yes -I'll refer to them as 'Big Climaxes'. Build-ups being a very key factors of music, I'm surprised so people find it negative. They're well done & well produced. They sound great! How can you not love the moment where Below My Feet breaks open, fully anthemic!
I Will Wait & Holland Road are probably the most (actually/genuinely) similar songs on the album -pretty much like Little Lion Man & White Black Page we're on 'Sigh No More'. Both move towards that 'Big Climax'. Both are very warm sounding songs.. and both are 2 very good songs! Holland Road being the better in my opinion.
Babel can be added those the other to as being very similar, but I'm not a big fan of Babel; the song.
Ghosts That We Knew is more subdued song, and pretty one at that. It's very gentle & only gets marginally bigger as the song progresses. It's not as soft & sweet Reminder, one of the highlights of the album, though.
Now Whispers in the Dark, Lover of the Light & Lover's Eyes can pretty much be paired together. All 3 are pretty bright songs. They're not my favorites, but good songs not the less.
Hopeless Wanderer & Broken Crown are two of the darker songs (compare them to I Gave You All and Thistle & Weeds) and are 2 of the best songs on the album. Broken Crown is some of the best songwriting on the album -maybe THE best-  despite the misfire that is 'I f*cked it all away'. Hopeless Wanderer starts with a  piano part that has a sense of yearning, which makes up the verse, with some added accompaniment. The chorus goes into full on acoustic rock & a rhythm change that tends to catch you off guard. This ones 'Big Climax' does not sound as warm & open as other songs on the record though.  It sounds more shrill & edgy.
Below My Feet is the 'Arena Anthem'. It's a favorite of mine.
Not With Haste is a slower song, comparable to Ghosts That We Knew in that aspect.. but different. Yearning rather than nostalgic & soaring rather than subdued, but never the point of the 'Big Climax'. Far from it.
The same can be said about For Those Below -it being slower. It has a very different melodic-style than anything else Mumford & Sons. It's probably my least favorite song on the (Deluxe Edition) album though.
The cover of The Boxer is a very good one. Collaborating with Paul Simon himself & Jerry Douglas, a resonator & pedal steel-guitarist. It's as said a very good cover, great production, great harmonies & some great leads of Jerry Douglas.
Where Are You Now. Another slowed down song, most akin to Ghosts That We Knew. It never gets big, with very subdued strumming & warm sounding guitar(s). It's lamenting & it's beautiful. A great song to end the (Deluxe Edition) album.
In the end (of this long review), I'll can only repeat. It's sound is more(/better) produced, rather than the more organic sound of 'Sigh No More'. But it genuinely is a better album. It's bigger, warmer, it has the a festival vibe, just like 'Sigh No More' had.. And there's really no better album to listen to on nice sunny days. The feel is perfect for that.",1,1,"Sep 21, 2013"

8,"Babel is, unfortunately, worse than Sigh no More. But that doesnt make it bad in any way. Its, from a critical standpoint, a solid album. Its BIG difference from Sigh No More is that Babel is really forgettable (in the sense that it isnt really catchy as its predecessor) and can very oftenly get boring. Songs are kinda same sounding and dont seem as diverse in melody as the first album. In this regard, the album is bordering poor.
However, the positives outshine the negatives in Babel. Lyrically, its a 10 out of 10. As always the band puts together amazing poetry to the songs. The first one depended heavily on influence by Shakespears writing, as well as quoting from the bible a couple of times. Babel improves on this, shaking off the dependence and making great lyrics from scratch. Song structure is also improved, changing up the verse-chorus-verse-chorus-bridge-chorus structure which was EVERYWHERE in Sigh No More. Babel is much more varied in that sense. Production is also a bit 'cleaner' than in Sigh No More. If this is positive or negative depends on the listener.
All in all, while Id give Sigh No More a 9.1, Babel is more of a 7.7 (8 here in Metacritic, I guess). But while Sigh No More could be listened several times, Babel I doubt I personally will hear much more. It is critically good, but isnt really memorable. Maybe itll grow on me later, but for now, its kind of a disappointment.",3,4,"Sep 26, 2012"

From the first track, Babel, to the last, Not with Haste, the sounds evolve, change, and end with a completely satisfied idea. The variation really shows the maturation of this band and the flawless execution of this album should leave everyone excited for not only the things to come, but the fact that we a witnessing a very special band.",3,4,"Sep 27, 2012"

For lovers of their first hit album Bable will continue to impress, yet it feels like the boys of Mumford and Sons haven",3,4,"Sep 27, 2012"
6,"First, I have to say that this is not a bad album, at all.  In fact, the lyrics are great, the rythms catchy and the vocals are amazing.  That being said, I'm a tad disappointed in this record.  I knew the band would not change their style (and I would not want that by any means), but my opinion is that there is such a redundancy in the songs, that not only do I feel like almost all the tracks sound the same, it also feels like it could be 'Sigh no more - part 2'.  I LOVED Sigh no more, so that's not the issue, but I wish they'd have explored, or innovate their potential.  In fact, I feel as if after their success with their first album, they were aiming more radio-time, more exposure (I can't criticize them for that, though), which lead to somewhat catchy, less original songs... less M&S, to be short.  I do think the songs, individually, are good.  The issue is when you listen to the whole album, it feels repetitive.  After listening to the record, I only felt like putting 'Sigh no more' back on my turntable... Sadly, I expected more of their second album, especially since I loved their first one so much.  All in all, this is a good album, great songs, great vocals and intrumental bits, BUT it feels like an arena-based album, less original, more catchy, more encline to meet everyone's tastes.  I love this band, so I really wish they don't become another not-so original indie band losing their originality to fit the radio mold.  Still, I'm not disappointed I bought the vinyl: good album, just not up to expectations!",3,4,"Dec 18, 2012"
9,"This is such a refreshing album! After hearing some of the complaints of this album it's like people didn't know what to expect from this band! They are a folk-rock band, why are people surprised that they released an album that has drawn so much reference and style from other folk bands! It is a mixture of powerful and heavy set songs that make you want to just move, and some amazingly heartfelt ballads. It is not quite the perfect album that 'Sigh No More' was but it I would happily listen to this over the mediocrity of modern music, the senseless and endless drones that you hear on the radio (Guetta, Skrillex, Rita Ora et al)

I understand it doesn't have tracks like 'Sign No More', 'The Cave' or 'Little Lion Man,' but it also doesn't have songs that are skip worthy (such as 'Dustbowl Dance'). On top of that, 'Below My Feet' may be one of their best tracks yet. Yeah, it all kind of sounds the same but that's the Mumford we've come to know and love, there are a few new elements to make this a great album.",2,3,"Sep 26, 2012"

4,"Repetitive. When I heard the title track, I was excited. It kept me juiced for three minutes, and it became horridly boring.

6,"I absolutely LOVE their debut Sigh No More.  One of my favorite popular albums of 2009.  Despite this however, I detected some hints of redundancy structurally on it, which I hoped they'd fix on their sophomore album.  Spoiler alert: THEY DIDN'T!  Now you'd think I, as a Mumford & Sons fan, would be thrilled that they'd release an album that sounds exactly like their debut.  But that's not how I listen to music.  I want bands to develop.  I want bands to evolve.  I want bands to experiment stylistically.  Or if they don't, they should at least keep their sound interesting.  Sadly, none of this happens.  Instead we get a watered-down, boring, predictable & rehashed version of their debut without nearly as many memorable melodies & lyrics.  Even when they did this repetitive formula on Sigh No More, they at least either gave songs different emotional vibes or (to some extent) different musical styles, or at least made them catchy enough that I wouldn't mind.  Here, it's nearly all the same, but this time with a slight hint of overproduction that makes a lot of the instruments just bleed together a lot of the time.  There's only a few songs here where something actually sticks in your head or makes any real impact.  The rest of the time it's somewhat poetic yet predictable lyrics with themes we've already heard over & over on previous Mumford & Sons songs (HE SAYS THE WORD 'HEART' IN 9/12 OF THE SONGS ON THE STANDARD EDITION!) combined with forgettable instrumentation & melodies that rarely even try to be catchy, but when they do it's not nearly enough to save it from mediocrity.  And even sometimes when the melodies themselves are good, they don't get good until the structure they've confined themselves in will allow it to be good.  Sometimes it doesn't get good until the loud part, or sometimes it stops being good at the loud part.  Heck, Reminder is the only song here that stays in one mode, and it's absolutely gorgeous!  The bonus tracks For Those Below & Where Are You Now also deviate a little, and they'd be very refreshing to hear on the standard edition.  And holy crap, can Winston please play more than one banjo picking pattern?!  It's the same one on every song!  Now if there's one thing I can say is a constant positive throughout Babel, it's that Marcus' vocals most of the time have a lot of passion & sincerity, which makes it even more sad that he insists on using them on these bland tracks  There were even times when I wished I could've been there at the recording sessions to tell him to sing a particular melody in a slightly different way to make it better.  Bottom line: okay album but it's very fair to say they've stagnated big-time with this one.  Please, Mumford & Sons, try something different next time.  Doesn't have to be a complete stylistic transformation but still, do something more interesting than this.  The 'dramatic buildup' gimmick is getting old.  Favorite tracks (in order): I Will Wait, Reminder, Babel, Hopeless Wanderer, Lover of the Light, For Those Below (bonus track), Broken Crown, Holland Road.  Least favorite tracks: All the other ones.  None are really 'bad' though.  Just boring, even if they're notable lyrically (i.e. Ghosts That We Knew & Not With Haste).  Overall score: 62/100",1,3,"Nov 24, 2012"
5,"I really liked their debut, but this is just a boring instauration from 'Sigh No More'. Instead of rememberable rhythms and interesting lyrics, almost every song on 'Babel' sounds the same. You have to have really low expectations to be not disappointed with this release. Their single 'I Will Wait' is the only really good song in here, the rest is pretty poor. But I'll give an extra point because of their style, which is nice. I like them but this album is nothing. It's really boring and so are the lyrics. They don't tell anything! However, it's not that bad, but you won't miss anything if you don't listen to 'Babel'.",1,3,"Nov 11, 2012"

Many people becuase of when they both rose in popularity compare these guys to The Avett Brothers.  That to me is a joke.  Avetts are better in about every way but lets just start with more complex lyrics with true meaning and understanding.  M&S are no different to Americana Folk music as Coldplay is to top 40.

6,"Mumford & Sons are one of the best folk bands on earth and this album is interesting and good to listen. However I noticed that some songs have almost the same instrumental performance.
I think that they should be more original with the instrumental aspect because with the voice the band has no problems. I really like Marcus Mumford's voice! The instrumental part is essential in every song and if they start to be uninteresting about it some new folk artists that are appearing now in the industry can become better and most succeeded",0,2,"Mar 22, 2013"

7,"Mumford & Sons follow up their very decent debut with more of the same. While the album isn't bad at all, the biggest complaint is that it doesn't really build on what has gone before, dishing up a very similar formula to the one which proved so successful on their debut. If this was their debut, I reckon people would be admiring it to an extent but unfortunately it's not. The saying 'If it aint broke don't fix it' isn't really applicable when it comes to music and art in general. I wouldn't go as far as to say the band knocked this album out for the money  but I can equally understand why people level that criticism at them.

7,"I loved 'Sigh No More'. It was a great album with some great music. That's why I was looking forward to listen to their next studio effort, 'Babel'. Honestly, it sounds just like their previous album. It's just that this one has more songs. There just isn't much difference in the instrumentals. (That obviously means that they're consistent with their music, which is very good.) If I had heard of Mumford & Sons for the first time because of THIS album, I would have definitely liked it more. The fact is, I've heard all this before, on their debut, 'Sigh No More'.
The reason I'm giving this a 7 is because I like this genre of music, and it's a good album on its own.
Congratulations on winning 'Album of the Year' for this, M&S!",0,0,"Feb  3, 2014"
6,"After their excellent debut, folk rock favourites Mumford and Sons released ''Babel''.
I had high expectations for this album, but found myself ultimately a little disappointed. Things start fairly well, with the thumping and lively title track, followed up by the rich and promising ''Whispers in the Dark''. The band's first single from the album, ''I will wait'', comes next and easily proves to be the highlight of the album, with it's constant tempo changes and melodies that build into a moving and raucous chorus.
After that though, things go gradually downhill. While it can't exactly be said that many of the tracks on this album provide poor listening (in fact, musically most are pretty accomplished), in terms of lyrical themes and construction they are generally below par and repetitive.
Though songs such as ''The ghosts that we knew'', ''Broken Crown'' and ''Hopeless Wanderer'' are aesthetically very decent tunes, in terms of general construction and lyrical content, it's as though they are re-hashed and poor relations of songs that appeared on debut album ''Sigh No More''. What's even more of a shame is that the band seem to have taken the easy ''well we were successful with it before, so why not re-hash it and release it again'' option, rather than being more brave.
Perhaps the finest piece of songwriting on the album comes in the shape of ''Constant Reminder'', a beautiful, immensely sad and powerful acoustic track; Well thought out, both in terms of lyrics and music. The Mumford's could perhaps have delivered something a little more memorable and longer lasting in memory if they'd have put their minds to it.",0,0,"Nov 13, 2015"

You really got to appreciate the lovely vocals of Ragnar rhallsson and Nanna Brynds Hilmarsdttir and the entire band's effort into making this record possible. What's funny is that it's their debut album so I can expect them to be even better in their future projects. People who keep on saying that they sound like Mumford & Sons, Edward Sharpe & the Magnetic Zeros or even Arcade Fire are just ignoring the fact that they all incorporate the same genre and even if they sound similar, that's an achievement for Of Monsters and Men.

I found that they're no one-hit wonder: he majority of the songs on the album are fantastic  featuring excellent melodies and most songs have lyrics that tell a little story, something desperately missing from most popular music today. In addition, these folks really know how to make a song  it's loud and complex during choruses, and simpler yet no less entertaining in verses. But trust me when I say that statement doesn't do the quality of the music justice.

8,"What I find most encouraging about My Head Is an Animal is the variety of what OMAM can produce. From the radio-fit pop sounds of Mountain Sound to the morose Love, Love, Love, to the rock-infused From Finner and the comtemplative Yellow Light. It's an eclectic mix of high-quality melodic pieces that at the same time doesn't feel like you're jumping across genres. I would have liked to have seen more vocal harmonies at play since it worked so well in Dirty Paws, instead of having so many tracks with the back-and forth between Nanna and Ragnar. The best tracks are split four ways for me between Dirty Paws, Mountain Sound, Love, Love, Love and Yellow Light, whose three minute instrumental to finish left me scrambling to listen again and again. Less inspired is King and Lionheart, which brings you down from the high of the lead track, and Lakehouse, which just didn't work for me. 7.5/10",0,0,"Jul 11, 2013"

9,"A very good album. Wesley Schultz is awesome at storytelling and expressing himself and the music itself is so beautifully chilling. In my opinion, they're a slower and more actual version of The Beatles (although I like The Lumineers more, actually). When they get quiet it sounds bodacious in 'Slow It Down', when they get happily it sounds gorgeous in 'Ho Hey', and so on. It's just beautiful from start to finish - as sunflower16 already said it, they're fantastic in making music. It's definitely one of the five best albums in the year 2012 and it's a romantic story about an abandoned lad. When Schultz starts to sing 'I belong with you, you belong with me, my sweetheart' in 'Ho Hey', I feel a mixture of happiness and sadness, that I haven't heard often before that particular song. I love this LP and you absolutely have to listen to this. Let's all hope they get even better with their future work!

Honestly, if music was ice cream, the Lumineers would be muesli-flavored. They're so bland, it makes me wanna puke.
If you want folk music that's actually fun to listen to, try Mumford and Sons. At least they spice their music up a bit by being more 'folk-rock,' which is much more appealing than this dull drivel.",1,6,"Feb  8, 2013"

Their music is so relaxing and easy to listen to that I play it for my nieces and they absolutely love it.  Whenever 'Ho Hey' or 'Submarines' comes on they start dancing like crazy!

7,"Ho Hey will probably automatically reveal why most people know of the Lumineers these days, but have you ever decided to dive deeper and check out their full CD?
Well, I decided to.
The self-titled debut album by the Denver, Colorado folk rock group is a quirky adventure and I found myself amused by it.  I like to call them the American version of the very popular folk rock band Mumford & Sons, except with a much more radio-like taste.
The album is overall inventive, but almost incomplete.  I was fond of the historical-like reference almost every song radiated.  I was transported from the WWII-era in one song to the 1920s jazz age in another.  I think many songs (Ho Hey, Stubborn Love, Dead Sea, etc.) are solid tunes that are friendly to listeners ears, while others (Slow It Down, Morning Song, etc.) are more drawn out, inventive, and abstract and shy away from the condensed-version most songs on the album seem to be.  I think they couldve definitely done more with their better known songs, but the short and speedy song is becoming more and more popular nowadays.  The 38 minute CD is a crash course for anyone who is skeptical about diving into folk rock music.  For a debut album, its promising.  The Lumineers know how to attract listeners with their catchy songs and overall positive vibe.  Id love to see them dive into darker depths and other subjects away from love in a future album.  The songwriting is there, and now that their first LP is out and appreciated, they should take some time and mold that potentially legendary talent into more great music.

As far as the lyrics... well, you probably won't feel deeply challenged by them, but if you're anything like me they'll manage to lodge themselves in your heart pretty quickly. Mitchell has a way of unfurling the story of a song in perfect synchrony with her song structures; 'Dyin' Day' is reminiscent of 'The Wall' from her Hadestown album, in that it slowly builds a powerful lyrical idea using repetitive but evolving call-and response verses. That song is a highlight. Others include the title track, whose restless, hungry hero evokes immediate sympathy, and 'Coming Down', a quiet and wistfully sad little tune.
I will say that beyond those songs, none of the others have really grabbed me in the two days I've had to listen to it, but that might be because I have tracks 2-4 more or less on repeat.

10,"In order to understand just how good an album this is, it's helpful to know some of the history of the Punch Brothers, particularly Chris Thile. He started off real young, as a kid who, just hitting double-digits in age, was already starting to show his virtuosity on the mandolin. He hit it big with the accessible, lovable trio Nickel Creek, who remain his most accessible work yet: the chemistry they had was remarkable, and their music was, again, perfectly accessible; it was music for the whole family, music you and your grandmother could enjoy together just as easily as you could alone. He was a happy, married, thoroughly successful man. --- It wouldn't last. His marriage started looking bad, a fact which he cataloged in his album Deceiver (an utterly excellent if slightly scattered pop album), and meanwhile, his relationship with childhood friends and fellow band members in Nickel Creek seemed to sour as well. The band announced that they were breaking up on the heels of their last album, properly titled 'Why Should the Fire Die?' Again, Thile's hope and heartbreak, his passion, his faith crisis were all on display. This intermediate, crash-and-burn period was, up until now, his best work. --- Thile divorced and, like any true genius, this personal toil translated into a masterpiece, which he called 'The Blind Leaving the Blind'. It was a five-voice bluegrass-classical fusion piece, as brilliant as it was passionate as was inaccessible, and thus Punch Brothers was born. They followed up with the decidedly bluegrassy 'Antifogmatic', which was a brilliant sophomore album, but a sophomore album nonetheless. Things were still rough around the edges, things were still gelling together, but it was easy to see that this was a band of virtuosi, led by Thile- and honestly, it wouldn't surprise me if Thile was the only man on earth who could front such a talented group. --- So, onto the album... It is a tremendous accomplishment. It is probably the only album ever to so harmoniously blend the complexity and depth of Radiohead with the decidedly everyman-ish aesthetic of bluegrass. One sees from the beginning the struggle of balance, between smoothness and edge, style and substance, showing off and keeping it all together. Listening to the album feels kind of like watching a tightrope walker lean back and forth with every step- and yet he never falls. The first track, 'Movement and Location', personifies the atmospheric, strength-in-unity element of the work whereas the title track shows off the snarl of rock, 'New York' the sheer virtuosity of each individual member. It all flows perfectly. And yes, the Kid A cover does the original every bit of justice, although I admit that I was hoping for some vocals in the listening; nonetheless, it captures the honest heartbreak and undisguised despair of its muse. Emotionally, the album's thick with resigned nihilism and sheer, inconsolable restlessness. It has its share of honest love and heartbreak, as well as equally honest misogyny. There's some substance use, some coldness and some heat. It's the band at their best as they capture the mood swings and confusion of the modern world. It makes for quite a character study. --- There's class. There's edge. There's seamless blending and stunning fingerwork. There's moments soft and hard, moments that spit in your face and moments that sooth and arouse contemplation. And yes, I'll say it: There's punch. If this was the best album of 2012, it would be a good year of music.",0,0,"Feb 16, 2012"
6,"Without a doubt Punch Brothers have the skills which many instrumentalist musicians might envy. Their bluegrass performance is high-flying one, but on the latest -  third album 'Who's Feeling Young Now?',  guys sometimes ovedid with its intensity, just like with the vocals -  and that's why songs sometimes seem chaotic. In any case this is not a bad album - just to mention bluegrass essence in the 'Movement and Location', quiet folk ballad 'Soon Or Never', or a great - totally instrumental country song: 'Flippen'. For the hesitant is worth mentioning that on the album there is absolutely brilliant cover of 'Kid A' by Radiohead.",0,0,"Apr 26, 2012"

All things considered, it's not terrible and certainly adds something different to the Christmas album market. The songwriting is solid but more reminisent of Ash's more recent A-Z stuff than their far superior back catalogue up to that point. The Ash sounding tracks carry the album for me. Zombie Christmas is a great single and has Ash all over it. An interesting release to say the least but if your going to check this out, please go in with your eyes open  this is a Christmas album and I seriously doubt Tim Wheeler meant it to be taken seriously.

Beautiful.",10,10,"Sep 11, 2012"
10,"Best Bob Dylan's effort in years. Bob remains as the truest storyteller in recent years and he is still on top of his game both lyrically and musically. Every track on this thing is a killer. Not a single word or chord is meaningless or out of touch. Instant classic and an essential album at the beginning of this decade.",5,5,"Sep 11, 2012"
9,"The title track is one of the most haunting pieces of music to be written in years. Bob is beyond brilliant. This album is just shy of a perfect score for me, but I am sure many will consider it to be flawless. 'Roll On John' is another personal favorite from the album.",2,2,"Sep 11, 2012"
10,"My opinion is that this is the best Bob Dylan album since Time Out of Mind and in some ways I like it even more than that.  Grew on me rather well with the first 7 or 8 listens.  Lots of highlights.  So many that the album itself is a magnificent highlight and it's the best thing I have heard so far this year, by far.  I also think it's one of Dylan's strongest efforts ever that has paid off in big dividends.  High praise for great work here.",2,2,"Sep 11, 2012"
9,"Tempest won't convert anyone who hasn't enjoyed Love and Theft or Modern Times but it's Dylan's best album in years. Great songwriting, the best band Dylan has had since The Band and, surprisingly given his past aversion to recording studios, Dylan's self-production is superb, crystal clear with his ravaged voice to the fore. Fantastic stuff. I suspect Nick Cave or Bonnie Prince Billy would've been happy to put their names to some some of these dark tales.",1,1,"Sep 11, 2012"
10,"So here we have it, what could possibly be Bob Dylan's final album. What can be said that hasn't already been said? This is his, in my personal opinion, his finest album since 1997's Time Out Of Mind. What I may say is that the album does feel more than the sum of its parts. Not all songs are fantastic with the lowest points being Roll On John and Soon After Midnight. While these songs are forgettable, they are by no means bad in any way with Roll On John being a sweet tribute to his old musical colleague John Lennon. Meanwhile highlights include the freewheelin ' style of Duquesne Whistle, the hypnotic Tin Angel and the epic 14 minute and 45 verse long title track. The most interesting aspect of the album is, as always with Bob Dylan, the lyrics. The imagery on this album is among the most vivid of his 50 year career with Tempest (the song) giving such a full picture that it is comparable to watching a film. And in the end of this song, the only one who remains is the watchman, lonely and pondering over events passed. One can only imagine that this is a metaphor for Dylan who stands alone in American music giving us his unique take on the world and still as ever, deep in his thoughts.",1,1,"Sep 12, 2012"
10,"Amazing album, especially for a 71 year old. But as Dylan ages, the quality and power of his music does not, and Tempest sees Dylan at top form with great new songs. The band is tight, and the music is much better rehearsed than Together Through Life and Christmas In The Heart. Also, Dylan's voice is clear and strong in the album, and is as emotive as always!",1,1,"Nov 21, 2012"
4,"Much acclaimed by the critics and topping the charts all over the world, I was expecting a lot of Bob Dylan's latest work. 'Tempest' has only got 10 songs, but lasts more than one hour as a whole. The thing he's doing here is versifying, actually. All of this 8 minute songs or so tell a long story, which is underlined with relaxing music. The problem is: the main riff stays the same in virtually all songs and that's bothersome. Musically it's relatively poor but the lyrics are pretty well, 'Tin Angel' has the very best, I opine.
All in all, 'Tempest' is average, additionally getting a minus point because of his voice, which got worse and worse over the years.",0,4,"Sep 27, 2012"

8,"Unbeliebably the master of song writing is still producing the goods more than half a century after he started out. It's one thing to be still recording at this stage in his career, but to be producing works of such high quality is really incredible. Everything that's needs to be said about Dylan has been said before so won't bang on about his legendary status but his his latest offering, Tempest follows the rich vein of form that saw Dylan produce 'Love  Theft' and 'Modern Times'. If you liked those records then your in for a treat. All the songs are between 7 and 9 out of 10 and there is a remarkable consistency throughout the record. Different songs stand out on different listens so it's hard to pick favourites. The title track, detailing the final hours of the Titanic, runs on for the best part of 14 minutes  a bit much you may think, but if you know Dylan, you'll know that some of his best work is also is lengthiest. Roll On John closes the record in fitting manner, a tip of the cap to John Lennon. This will delight existing fans and perhaps may attract a few open minded people who've not yet discovered this genius.",0,0,"Mar  1, 2013"

The best are old songs that have been around forever like Once and Future Carpenter,Down With the Shine,Pretty Girl From Michigan(Telling Time). Imo the best song they have ever written is Die Then Grow which it too has been around forever.  It surprisingly is a 'bonus track' only available at Target.  Good thing I got that one.  You can tell the brothers got married and had kids in the lyrics they wrote.  Paul Newman is my one complaint.  It never really works throughout the song and does not fit on this album imo.  February 7 and Life are great tunes.",1,1,"Sep 13, 2012"
6,"Over the last couple of years, the Avett Brothers have expanded their fan base substantially.  For those of us a fan of their earlier efforts, this album is too polished, poppy, and radio-friendly.  In fact, I think it is a decent album, but has none of the characteristics that made me a huge Avett Brothers fan in the first place.  Change and growth is great, but in this case I think they should not have chosen Rick Rubin to produce them.  He should stick to the Red Hot Chili Peppers and Linkin Park and not ruin great bands like the Avett Brothers.",1,1,"Sep 14, 2012"

4,"Their sound is polished, but that's not necessarily a good thing. I suppose I should have expected the album to have this pop-rock sound after I and Love and You, an album I ignored after the first listen other than about four of its tracks. The songs on The Carpenter feel safe and sterile; there's no raw energy, passion, or honest emotion that I loved about the Avetts in the past. The first two tracks are by far the best, but even Live and Die would be a weak effort on, say, Emotionalism. The rest are mostly sad, slow, and nostalgic, with lots of trite metaphors about seasons.",0,1,"Oct  3, 2012"
10,"The much anticipated new album from The Avett Brothers is finally here, and it was worth the wait. 'The Carpenter' is a combination of all of that is great about this band. Teaming up once again with Rick Rubin, this album proves that The Avett Brothers are here to stay. The title track 'The Once and Future Carpenter' plays like a life story, with poetic lyrics and a toe-tapping bluegrass beat. Their first release, 'Live and Die', pulls you in with the banjo and then makes you want to get up and swing your sweetheart around the room.
The smoky ballad 'Winter in my Heart' slows the pace a bit, but not the momentum of the beautiful lyrics and sweet vocals. There is such honesty in these songs that my heart aches a bit with each verse. 'They say seasons turn in time. Their's are changing; why won't mine.'
'Pretty Girl from Michigan' begins with the piano and then breaks into a bluegrass/rock anthem reminiscent of the late 50's and sock hops without being hokey and derivative. 'I Never Knew You' reminds me of The Beautiful South with the harmonies and slightly biting lyrics. It definitely put a smile on my face.
'Life' reminds us of the impermanence of life. The floating melodies are played with such grace on the guitar and backed by the violin. This song is best appreciated by closing your eyes, putting on your headphones and leaning your head back and giving in to it. 'Through My Prayers' brings to mind a lost love that was hard to give up. Regret and heartache make this one such a poignant song.
One song that brings a new sound to the group is 'Paul Newman vs. The Demons'. Less acoustic than most of their other songs with a more prominent drum beat and some latin electric guitar sounds, this song demonstrates the versatility of the band. They are not just a one trick pony.
As with their previous album, this one is going to be a favorite of mine. I highly recommend that you check it out along with the rest of their albums. You can download it now at iTunes at this link:

I love the songs on this album, but they all seem like filler songs. Not to mention 3 or 4 of these songs have already been on youtube for years, they're just redone with special sound effects. I had been looking forward to this album for years and it just fell short. The lyrics do seem much more shallow than they were in Far, Soviet Kitsch, and ESPECIALLY Begin to Hope. Some of them just didn't seem like Spektor at all! How isn't original at all, something I would never expect from my favorite musician.

Since her first major album, Soviet Kitsch, was released in 2004, Spektor has entertained listeners not only with her impressively broad vocals but with beatboxing, dolphin noises, mesmerizing French and Russian lyrics, and many other interesting stylistic choices.

9,"Regina Spektor is one of those artists hardly anyone likes at first. Like liquor. She's a lyrically puzzling, piano thumping storytelling with vocal arrangements as dramatic as a theater major... but also much like liquor, once you really get into the music, it becomes an uncontrollable addiction. What We Saw From the Cheap Seats is like a delicious fruity drink with deadly amounts of mixed vodkas and gins. It will knock you on your ass when you're done with it. It's definitely Spektor's most down-to-Earth, calm album yet, with productions quality at an all-time high, but her identity as a humbly strange anti-folk legend remains.Spektor seems to be more aware of herself and her talents on this album, using more accents ('Oh Marcello'), beat boxing ('All The Rowboats') and hand-and-feet instrumentation ('Small Town Moon') than seen on any of her previous albums. She even steps out from behind the piano to play the trumpet in 'The Party,' with only her mouth and no trumpet of course.Before the album is even halfway over she gives us one of her most beautifully depressing ballads in years with 'Firewood,' which rivals Begin to Hope track 'Samson' both musically and vocally. A couple tracks later and again she ups the ante with 'How,' a song about heartbreak so jarring that it could make even Duffy or Adele seem as cheerful as Ke$ha. Still, Spektor isn't all about depressing hidden meanings and quirky, cutesy air instruments. She has, over the years, been uncovering a more pop side of herself that seems to shine on each album like 'Folding Chair' from Far or 'Better' from Begin to Hope. This album offers up 'The Party' which compares a swain to a lively parade that leaves you messily frazzled and smiling. 'Ballad of a Politician' is the most nostalgic record, reminiscent of tracks like 'Chemo Limo' that chronicle corruption, a favorite topic of mine. It's hard to put Spektor is to one category or another. Her music bounces from between different genres and themes. She's an explorer. An acquired taste, yes, but she definitely knows exactly who she is and what she wants her music to sound like. Now that she has a bigger budget and production team behind her, moreso than her first 5 albums, she can bring that huge imagination out of her head and into our ears.",1,1,"May 29, 2012"

What's funny is that it's their debut album so I can expect them to be even better in their future projects. People who keep on saying that they sound like Mumford & Sons, Edward Sharpe & the Magnetic Zeros or even Arcade Fire are just ignoring the fact that they all incorporate the same genre and even if they sound similar, that's an achievement for Of Monsters and Men.

In addition, these folks really know how to make a song  it's loud and complex during choruses, and simpler yet no less entertaining in verses.

It's an eclectic mix of high-quality melodic pieces that at the same time doesn't feel like you're jumping across genres. I would have liked to have seen more vocal harmonies at play since it worked so well in Dirty Paws, instead of having so many tracks with the back-and forth between Nanna and Ragnar. The best tracks are split four ways for me between Dirty Paws, Mountain Sound, Love, Love, Love and Yellow Light, whose three minute instrumental to finish left me scrambling to listen again and again. Less inspired is King and Lionheart, which brings you down from the high of the lead track, and Lakehouse, which just didn't work for me. 7.5/10",0,0,"Jul 11, 2013"

9,"A very good album. Wesley Schultz is awesome at storytelling and expressing himself and the music itself is so beautifully chilling. In my opinion, they're a slower and more actual version of The Beatles (although I like The Lumineers more, actually). When they get quiet it sounds bodacious in 'Slow It Down', when they get happily it sounds gorgeous in 'Ho Hey', and so on. It's just beautiful from start to finish - as sunflower16 already said it, they're fantastic in making music. It's definitely one of the five best albums in the year 2012 and it's a romantic story about an abandoned lad. When Schultz starts to sing 'I belong with you, you belong with me, my sweetheart' in 'Ho Hey', I feel a mixture of happiness and sadness, that I haven't heard often before that particular song. I love this LP and you absolutely have to listen to this. Let's all hope they get even better with their future work!

Honestly, if music was ice cream, the Lumineers would be muesli-flavored. They're so bland, it makes me wanna puke.
If you want folk music that's actually fun to listen to, try Mumford and Sons. At least they spice their music up a bit by being more 'folk-rock,' which is much more appealing than this dull drivel.",1,6,"Feb  8, 2013"

Their music is so relaxing and easy to listen to that I play it for my nieces and they absolutely love it.  Whenever 'Ho Hey' or 'Submarines' comes on they start dancing like crazy!

7,"Ho Hey will probably automatically reveal why most people know of the Lumineers these days, but have you ever decided to dive deeper and check out their full CD?
Well, I decided to.
The self-titled debut album by the Denver, Colorado folk rock group is a quirky adventure and I found myself amused by it.  I like to call them the American version of the very popular folk rock band Mumford & Sons, except with a much more radio-like taste.
The album is overall inventive, but almost incomplete.  I was fond of the historical-like reference almost every song radiated.  I was transported from the WWII-era in one song to the 1920s jazz age in another.  I think many songs (Ho Hey, Stubborn Love, Dead Sea, etc.) are solid tunes that are friendly to listeners ears, while others (Slow It Down, Morning Song, etc.) are more drawn out, inventive, and abstract and shy away from the condensed-version most songs on the album seem to be.  I think they couldve definitely done more with their better known songs, but the short and speedy song is becoming more and more popular nowadays.  The 38 minute CD is a crash course for anyone who is skeptical about diving into folk rock music.  For a debut album, its promising.  The Lumineers know how to attract listeners with their catchy songs and overall positive vibe.  Id love to see them dive into darker depths and other subjects away from love in a future album.  The songwriting is there, and now that their first LP is out and appreciated, they should take some time and mold that potentially legendary talent into more great music.

8,"It's expansive Americana/folk. It sounds great, with deep and spacious arrangements. The melodies are accessible and some are quite catchy, but off-center enough not to be boringly predictable. As far as the lyrics... well, you probably won't feel deeply challenged by them, but if you're anything like me they'll manage to lodge themselves in your heart pretty quickly. Mitchell has a way of unfurling the story of a song in perfect synchrony with her song structures; 'Dyin' Day' is reminiscent of 'The Wall' from her Hadestown album, in that it slowly builds a powerful lyrical idea using repetitive but evolving call-and response verses. That song is a highlight. Others include the title track, whose restless, hungry hero evokes immediate sympathy, and 'Coming Down', a quiet and wistfully sad little tune.
I will say that beyond those songs, none of the others have really grabbed me in the two days I've had to listen to it, but that might be because I have tracks 2-4 more or less on repeat.

10,"In order to understand just how good an album this is, it's helpful to know some of the history of the Punch Brothers, particularly Chris Thile. He started off real young, as a kid who, just hitting double-digits in age, was already starting to show his virtuosity on the mandolin. He hit it big with the accessible, lovable trio Nickel Creek, who remain his most accessible work yet: the chemistry they had was remarkable, and their music was, again, perfectly accessible; it was music for the whole family, music you and your grandmother could enjoy together just as easily as you could alone. He was a happy, married, thoroughly successful man. --- It wouldn't last. His marriage started looking bad, a fact which he cataloged in his album Deceiver (an utterly excellent if slightly scattered pop album), and meanwhile, his relationship with childhood friends and fellow band members in Nickel Creek seemed to sour as well. The band announced that they were breaking up on the heels of their last album, properly titled 'Why Should the Fire Die?' Again, Thile's hope and heartbreak, his passion, his faith crisis were all on display. This intermediate, crash-and-burn period was, up until now, his best work. --- Thile divorced and, like any true genius, this personal toil translated into a masterpiece, which he called 'The Blind Leaving the Blind'. It was a five-voice bluegrass-classical fusion piece, as brilliant as it was passionate as was inaccessible, and thus Punch Brothers was born. They followed up with the decidedly bluegrassy 'Antifogmatic', which was a brilliant sophomore album, but a sophomore album nonetheless. Things were still rough around the edges, things were still gelling together, but it was easy to see that this was a band of virtuosi, led by Thile- and honestly, it wouldn't surprise me if Thile was the only man on earth who could front such a talented group. --- So, onto the album... It is a tremendous accomplishment. It is probably the only album ever to so harmoniously blend the complexity and depth of Radiohead with the decidedly everyman-ish aesthetic of bluegrass. One sees from the beginning the struggle of balance, between smoothness and edge, style and substance, showing off and keeping it all together. Listening to the album feels kind of like watching a tightrope walker lean back and forth with every step- and yet he never falls. The first track, 'Movement and Location', personifies the atmospheric, strength-in-unity element of the work whereas the title track shows off the snarl of rock, 'New York' the sheer virtuosity of each individual member. It all flows perfectly. And yes, the Kid A cover does the original every bit of justice, although I admit that I was hoping for some vocals in the listening; nonetheless, it captures the honest heartbreak and undisguised despair of its muse. Emotionally, the album's thick with resigned nihilism and sheer, inconsolable restlessness. It has its share of honest love and heartbreak, as well as equally honest misogyny. There's some substance use, some coldness and some heat. It's the band at their best as they capture the mood swings and confusion of the modern world. It makes for quite a character study. --- There's class. There's edge. There's seamless blending and stunning fingerwork. There's moments soft and hard, moments that spit in your face and moments that sooth and arouse contemplation. And yes, I'll say it: There's punch. If this was the best album of 2012, it would be a good year of music.",0,0,"Feb 16, 2012"
6,"Without a doubt Punch Brothers have the skills which many instrumentalist musicians might envy. Their bluegrass performance is high-flying one, but on the latest -  third album 'Who's Feeling Young Now?',  guys sometimes ovedid with its intensity, just like with the vocals -  and that's why songs sometimes seem chaotic. In any case this is not a bad album - just to mention bluegrass essence in the 'Movement and Location', quiet folk ballad 'Soon Or Never', or a great - totally instrumental country song: 'Flippen'. For the hesitant is worth mentioning that on the album there is absolutely brilliant cover of 'Kid A' by Radiohead.",0,0,"Apr 26, 2012"

10,"First of all, it is important to note that this is NOT a straight-up bluegrass album. This is easily one of my favorite albums, period. I can listen to it any time. The title track, Who's Feeling Young Now, gives off the intensity and energy of a punk-rock ballad. And the arpeggios used in Don't Get Married blow my mind. If you have a chance to see this talented group live, you will not be disappointed.",0,0,"Jan  7, 2014"
10,"Really really REALLY just damn perfect.  In every way possible.  I have nothing critical to say about this album.  She does 2 covers, one of Radiohead's 'The Tourist' and Dylan's 'Ring them bells'. 'Tourist' is done with a very bluegrassy sound and what we get is a haunting, slower version of the OK COmputer closer.  Her cover of 'Bells' owns Dylan.  Which is not easy to do.  Granted it was 80s Dylan not 60s Dylan but still...",0,0,"Jun  9, 2011"
9,"Leonard Cohen emerges like a specter from the shadows to deliver this gem of an album.  The arrrangements are minimal which allow the focus to be entirely on Cohen's weathered voice as he sings about love, loss, longing, regret and salvation with the fervor and passion that artists half his age have trouble mustering up.  A true work of art.",3,3,"Feb  3, 2012"

8,"Leonard Cohen needs no recommendation. Who had heard songs like 'In My Secret Life' and 'Dance Me To The End Of Love', artist's latest album entitled 'Old Ideas' will please them. For the rest of listeners it's the first in eight years opportunity to familiarize yourself with unique vocals and poetic style of Cohen's songs. The album consists entirely different compositions - from sung poetry in 'Going Home' and 'Anyhow', the subtle ballad 'Show Me The Place', acoustic and gentle 'Crazy To Love You' to careless folk song - 'Banjo'. A solid entry in the discography of the artist.",0,0,"Apr 26, 2012"
6,"Unlike most other Cohen albums, this one has some personality. The lyrics are thoughtful and meaningful, and the instrumentation is the best I've ever heard on a Cohen record. However, the production quality is abysmal, and there are a few tracks that slip back into the style of Dear Heather, which was terrible. On tracks like The Darkness, the groove is interesting and the organ solo is great. Cohen has some awesome moments on this LP, but he fails to keep the momentum for the entire album.",0,0,"Dec 14, 2014"

Over sentimental, overly borrowed, overly styled, overly lacking in content. I'm sure there's someone trying on a tight fitting grey pleather jacket and seeing which pouty face goes with it and I'm sure this person likes the band and would make an impassioned argument against my claims. If it wasn't for the uninspired live performance I may have kept said opinion to myself. But sister, this is a cruel world and some people are gonna knock the stuff you like. And sister, sometimes they're right.",2,3,"Dec 10, 2013"

It's both original and is quite far from being repetitive.
Give this album a listen from an amazing band that might have had it's best work on it's first wide release album, which is getting more typical these days.

9,"Tomboy arrives four years after Panda Bear's brilliant Person Pitch.  Tomboy largely fulfills expectations, but some may be divided over the more conventional song structures Noah Lennox uses this time.   There are no sprawling jams like 'Good Girl/Carrots'; 'Afterburner,' the longest track, clocks in at 6:50, while the other ten tracks hover around four minutes.  Still, this is Panda Bear.  He nails the Beach Boys layered lyrics, combing those with burbling sounds, synths, and guitars to create dreamy, unique songs.  Lennox's singing is top notch - he uses his voice to swing us from moods of warmth, desolation, hope.  Tomboy starts modestly and builds to a powerful finish, fluctuating with imaginative ideas throughout.  Fans should be pleased over this effort; it's also one of the best of 2011 so far.  RECOMMENDED TRACKS: Tomboy, Last Night at the Jetty, Afterburner",2,2,"Apr 12, 2011"
8,"Took a few listens to realise just how many great songs there are on this one. Overall though, I don't find it as memorable or versatile as Person Pitch. I get bored listening to this LP the whole way through at times because the songs have a very similar feel to them, but as individual tracks I can't fault them.",2,2,"May 11, 2011"
9,"So far, it's my favorite album of this year next to Toro Y Moi's Underneath The Pine. It's an improved Person Pitch with some occasional dub influence; at the same it's equally more guitar and beat oriented. Trancey post-rock electronic indie rock at its finest.",1,1,"Apr 12, 2011"

8,"Brilliant album, even not following the sampler-based and brilliant too Person Pitch; Noah's still delivering his best melodies and lyrics. Slow Motion and Last Night at the Jetty are the highlights, the reverbed guitars and the strange noises mixed with more minimal percussion create one of the best albums of 2011.",1,1,"Apr 19, 2011"

It all seemed to be around the same level, and became a little boring towards the end of listening.

All things considered, it's not terrible and certainly adds something different to the Christmas album market. The songwriting is solid but more reminisent of Ash's more recent A-Z stuff than their far superior back catalogue up to that point. The Ash sounding tracks carry the album for me. Zombie Christmas is a great single and has Ash all over it. An interesting release to say the least but if your going to check this out, please go in with your eyes open  this is a Christmas album and I seriously doubt Tim Wheeler meant it to be taken seriously. Hopefully anyway",0,0,"May 21, 2013"

Some intense songs, alluring love songs, and mellow songs that are uplifting yet sad at the same time. Listening to this album, even to the more upbeat and intense tracks, it provides a certain warmth. Favorites are 'The Wolves' 'Everything' 'Keep Your Head Up' even the several bonus tracks we get are unique with the even-more folk oriented guitar parts.",0,0,"Jun 17, 2014"

6,"This is a band that shows some good potential and they are pretty decent at their playing. While this is a green score, it's more like barely above average; the songs wear out their welcome too quickly, the mix of folk, blues, and rock is executed not too well, and it just feels too long for its own good. The band is interesting though and when they make good music, the music is pretty damn good. Hopefully future outputs will be much better than this.",0,0,"Mar 20, 2011"
8,"Strong follow up to her lovely debut solo record Sea Sew. Lisa Hannigan has a more expansive sound on Passenger but deep down it is a record cut from the same cloth. The songs are very strong, the voice is as good as ever and it's a more lively and in my opinion a stronger record than Sea Sew which got a Mercury Music Prize nomination. Passenger goes further in establishing her as an artist in her own right and has some great singles on it.  She has her own style and sound and is growing her own fan base independant of her past musical partnerships with Damien Rice. Another couple of albums like this and it may be a case of Damien Who?",0,0,"Apr 30, 2012"

7,"Because I was drawn to the album by hearing the title cut, I was disappointed to find that it was atypical.  'Barton Hollow,' the song, layers the lovely harmonies of The Civil Wars over raw blues-based rock, producing a tense, edgy beauty that is, in a word, sublime.  The rest of the album generally lacks that tension, opting for loveliness alone.  There's nothing wrong with sounding lovely, of course, and the voices of John Paul White and Joy Williams truly do, being perfectly matched and preternaturally responsive to one another.  But the best of the slower, sweeter songs, in my opinion, is the duo's cover of Leonard Cohen's 'Dance Me to the End of Love,' with its terrifying murderous subtext, so, once again, dissonant elements seem to raise their game.  So far, their folkier songwriting tends not to introduce such elements, despite being much enamored of paradox in their lyrics ('I don't love you, but I always will').  So these songs feel flat to me--lovely, but flat.  A hundred thousand 'Gray's Anatomy' fans disagree, however, so feel free to love this album unreservedly.  If you're a fan of the sublime, however (and you know what the sublime is), then you may want just to download the two songs I've mentioned (and, perhaps 'Birds of a Feather,' which has a little rawness to it) then wait to see where this band goes.  Given their name, they should be all about the tension between harmony and discord--in their music, as well as their lyrics.",0,0,"Oct  2, 2011"
8,"The Civil Wars build off of Allison Kraus and The Swell Season in a very effective way.  The ballads are lovely and carefully crafted.

She was heading in this direction in 2009 with 'Speaking a Dead Language' only to discover the perfect compliment in John Paul White, whose the voice and body frames her masterfully.  As good as this album is they are even better live where the harmony of their entire selves shines through. Their remake of 'Dance Me to the End of Love is better than the original. Their musical style is likely too niche to achieve mainstream success but  they will go on to build a devoted (even rabid) fan base. Count me as being on the bandwagon, right now.",0,0,"Dec 29, 2011"
8,"Very emotionally driven album. Every song supports the controlling theme of struggling with love and searching in everything for it. The song 'To Whom It May Concern' speaks deeply to the struggle of the search and the passion for what is in store, where 'The Violet Hour' gives a mesmerizing expression that can't be expressed with words. Excellent album, and I would recommend it to anyone, especially those searching for a deeper, more passionate meaning in their music.",0,0,"Dec  1, 2011"

But the one thing really bringing this purchase home was the extra live disk you got if you ordered it from Amazon (Brandeis 1963). It's short and the audio isn't consistently good (it's not consistently good in the regular 2-disk set either) but the show is equal parts playful and serious, lots of energy in the performances, and it's always a good thing to have another document of early Dylan live.
