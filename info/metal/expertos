Kerrang!,80,"Gorguts are no strangers to ambition, always pushing themselves to find beauty in the darkest, most sinister tales of our checkered evolution.

Absolute Punk (Staff reviews),78,"Small Turn's greatest strength is also its primary flaw; they do this particular sort of downtrodden as well as anybody, but given all they're capable of, it's a shame that they limit themselves to such a small sonic palette.

The Guardian,70,"While lack of tunefulness has rarely been an issue for noise-rock fans, A Small Turn of Human Kindness's abstractness makes it a little less satisfying than its predecessor.

Absolute Punk (Staff reviews),50,"Year of the Black Rainbow is not a bad album.

AllMusic,90,"Dissonant strings, clasical piano and eerie quiet spells infuse the album with a wird, roiling darkness that gets under your skin rather than filleting your skull.

Alternative Press,90,"Option Paralysis equivocates the maturation of musical ideas over the Dillinger Escape Plan's storied career, as Miss Machine and Ire Works are currently looking as mere test samples leading up to this point.

PopMatters,72,"2004's Miss Machine and 2007's Ire Works offered an ever-broadening sound that kinda-sorta skirted crossover-friendliness, a sometimes awkward mash of traditional, melodic rock and hideous shrieking and bashing. Option Paralysis continues in that vein for better or worse.","Apr 13, 2010"
Sputnikmusic,70,"For years, Dillinger Escape Plan have been the metal standard-bearers of dizzying, time-signature torture, though they have occasionally eased up to construct NIN-damaged, alt-rock superhero fantasies. The band's fourth album gives these two personalities their most seamless marriage to date.","Apr 13, 2010"
The A.V. Club,70,"The whole record possesses an industrial feel, be it in the synths or the drum machines or the moody-sounding atmospherics that are peppered throughout the record. Option Paralysis, may not win back fair-weather fans, but they've again proved why they're regarded as one of the best in their field.","Apr 13, 2010"
Alternative Press,70,"Although it doesn't pack any real surprises, this album marks a fascinating turning point for the band.

PopMatters,70,"Although this doesn't quite scale the heights of their two previous LPs, 'Death Is This Communion' and 'Blessed Black Wings,' it shouldn't be thought of as a point of no return. As ambassadors for metal, they remain near-peerless.","Apr 13, 2010"
Mojo,70,"The production jars mainly on the opener, 'Snakes For the Divine' - Pike's leads sound wankier, and Kensel's drums flatter and softer, than one might want. But overall, Fidelman's work doesn't obtrude too badly.","Apr 13, 2010"

Billboard.com,77,"Shining are combining jazz and metal in original ways, from the filling up of jazz's precious empty spaces with ticking nervous energy to the replacement of metal's vocal aggression with creepy and disconnected noise.

Hartford Courant,80,"First off, a warning: the best way to encounter Mastodon's Crack the Skye for the first time is with headphones. Reported to be a mystical -- if crunchy -- concept record about Tsarist Russia, this is actually the most involved set of tracks, both in terms of music and production, the band has ever recorded. 'Ambitious' is a word that regularly greets Mastodon -- after all, they did an entire album based on Moby Dick -- but until now, that adjective may have been an understatement. There is so much going on in these seven tracks that it's difficult to get it all in a listen or two (one of the reasons that close encounters of the headphone kind are recommended). It may seem strange that the band worked with Bruce Springsteen producer Brendan O'Brien this time out, but it turns out to be a boon for both parties: for the band because O'Brien is obsessive about sounds, textures, and finding spaces in just the right places; for O'Brien because in his work with the Boss he's all but forgotten what the sounds of big roaring electric guitars and overdriven thudding drums can sound like. The guitar arrangements on tracks like 'Divinations' and 'The Czar,' while wildly different from one another, are the most intricate, melodically complex things the band has ever recorded. There are also more subtle moments such as the menacing, brooding, and ultimately downer cuts such as 'The Last Baron,' where tempos are slowed and keyboards enter the fray and stretch the time, adding a much more multidimensional sense of atmosphere and texture. Still, Crack the Skye rocks, and hard! Its shifting tempos and key structures are far more meaty and forceful than most prog metal, and menace and cosmological speculation exist in equal measure, providing for a spot-on sense of balance. Some of the hardcore death metal conservatives may have trouble with this set, but the album wasn't recorded for them -- or anybody else. Crack the Skye is the sound of a band stretching itself to its limits and exploring the depth of its collective musical identity as a series of possibilities rather than as signatures. And yes, that is a good thing.","Sep 30, 2008"

Prefix Magazine,60,"Motley Crue has been trumpeting their hedonism for so long and so loudly that it's become more of a caricature than a way of life, and while Saints of Los Angeles is the best thing they've laid to tape since their codpiece heydays, it's more of a walk down memory lane/sunset strip than a legitimate call to arms.","Oct 31, 2006"
The Wire,60,"The trip down memory lane helps the Cre connect to their old sound: Much of Saints rocks with the same raucous fun as their Eighties albums, delivering glam guitars and arena-size choruses on cuts like the wickedly catchy 'Down at the Whisky.'","Oct 31, 2006"
Uncut,60,"While Saints Of Los Angeles is occasionally stunning, as is consistent with Sixxs recent return to form, it often sounds too much like something Nikki Sixx would expect Cre fans to like, rather than the top-class rock n roll hes time-and-time-again proven himself capable of making.","Oct 31, 2006"

AllMusic,37,"There is some of the old energy here, thanks in part to the presence of drummer Tommy Lee, who drives 'Down at the Whisky' and 'Chicks=Trouble' like somebody with a head full of stimulants.

The A.V. Club,80,"Unflinchingly heavy, this midtempo metal won't disappoint believers. [June 2003, p.101]","Mar 20, 2001"
Alternative Press,75,"Rages and riffs with epic drama.","Mar 20, 2001"
Pitchfork,50,"Faceless... grooves more fluidly than Awake, but the band still hasn't managed to locate the pop hooks that made their debut a success.","Mar 20, 2001"
E! Online,42,"Mostly it's the same staccato riffing, constipated vocals, and generic, rage-against-the-kidney-stone angst. [11 Apr 2003, p.78]","Mar 20, 2001"
AllMusic,40,"Faceless is exactly that. [May 2003, p.120]","Mar 20, 2001"

The A.V. Club,83,"A thunderously hooky album that seamlessly blends the group's disparate sonic elements into radio-friendly perfection.","Mar  6, 2001"
Rolling Stone,80,"Isn't so much a revelation as it is a ready-made crowd pleaser that delivers on the familiar.","Mar  6, 2001"
Q Magazine,80,"Miraculously, given the similarity of the design, 'Meteora' avoids being a stagnant retread of 'Hybrid Theory'.","Mar  6, 2001"
Dot Music,70,"While being as well-crafted, catchy and dynamic as the first one, it leaves you feeling distinctly underwhelmed, as if the band had simply reprogrammed the Pro-Tools machine that they'd made the first album on and changed the lyrics and speed of the songs a bit.","Mar  6, 2001"
Alternative Press,70,"The band manages to squeeze the last remaining life out of this nearly extinct formula with volatile performances and meticulous editing.","Mar  6, 2001"
Q Magazine,60,"The similarity of Meteroa to Hybrid Theory does not only raise the question of where do they go from here, but whether there is a place for them to go at all.","Mar  6, 2001"
New Musical Express (NME),60,"Harder, denser, uglier. [#15, p.128]","Mar  6, 2001"

Spin,40,"Many of the choruses are great, but by about track eight you begin to realise this isn't about songs, this is about mathematics, and if you've actually paid for the album with your own money, you've been well and truly had.","Mar  6, 2001"
E! Online,40,"Mercifully brief but mercilessly repetitive, Meteora is little more than a tolerable rehash of a formula that's been on the wrong side of its sell-by date for some time now.","Mar  6, 2001"

The A.V. Club,100,"The focus may be tighter and the refinement may be a little more obvious, but such things don't hold the band back on Antenna; rather they further the progress that has been showing itself with every Cave In release.","Jan 23, 2001"

Alternative Press,90,"Like both Radiohead and Foo Fighters, Cave In is a stylistic chameleon that rarely uses its freewheeling taste as a crutch to present self-indulgent material.","Jan 23, 2001"
Blender,90,"The songs may pay excessive homage in spirit, but their composition and divergent tones are wholly original.","Jan 23, 2001"
Playlouder,83,"It sounds as if a bunch of no-bullshit straight-edgers have been cooped up in an underground drug den for a week with only Pink Floyd records for company, and then released blinking into the daylight and shuttled immediately into the recording studio.","Jan 23, 2001"
Amazon.com,80,"When you cover this sort of expansive, experimental territory, you're inevitably flirting with pomposity. But like Tool or Radiohead, Cave-In's progressiveness is hypnotic rather than alienating, played out with a sense of near-religious awe that's difficult to deny.","Jan 23, 2001"
Alternative Press,80,"A truly remarkable progression, and a great album to boot--Antenna is the work of a band that's constantly moving forward.","Jan 23, 2001"

Entertainment Weekly,70,"The songs transform emo's search for truth and its vivid angst into great drama. [#15, p.122]","Jan 23, 2001"
Blender,70,"There's plenty of pretense in the long-winded tone poems... But they also know how to deliver a concise pop song.","Jan 23, 2001"

E! Online,40,"The group has abruptly cashed in a good deal of its personality for an unflattering, generic modern-rock sound.","Jan 23, 2001"
Entertainment Weekly,40,"Antenna is lacking in every sonic department they previously thrived upon and sounds exactly what fans of old feared: immaculate, sterile guitar production; rigid, radio-ready song structures; and an end to the dynamic, cosmos-exploring sound that elevated Jupiter to a stunning success.","Jan 23, 2001"

Billboard,100,"The quintet's Molotov mixture of suburb surrealism and sonic extremity is the perfect scrub for everything you've been subjected to in culture and daily life. [Apr 2003, p.73]","Dec 12, 2000"
Dot Music,100,"The most prolific, beautiful, and vital statement of rock since the Stooges' Raw Power.","Dec 12, 2000"
New Musical Express (NME),94,"Burn, Piano Island, Burn is an album that must first be listened to twice: once to wrap your head around its peerless vigor and skull-rattling force, and again to revel in its restless creativity.","Dec 12, 2000"

Uncut,80,"It's the band's most vital disc to date, and one of the year's most memorable listening experiences.","Dec 12, 2000"
Playlouder,75,"The Blood Brothers' take on hardcore incorporates all the shouty vocals, savage guitar riffing, and hyperspeed drumming you could ask for, but throws in two--sometimes counterproductive--vocalists, and loopy lyrics that aim for surrealist poetry and usually miss, badly. [11 Apr 2003, p.78]","Dec 12, 2000"
The A.V. Club,70,"The album's clever turns don't take away from The Blood Brothers as a ravaging hardcore band; instead, they enlist chops in service of a manic vision all the more insinuating for its brutality.","Dec 12, 2000"
Delusions of Adequacy,70,"In one instant, lead singer Jordan Blilie is whispering passionately in your ear. In the next, he tears into your insides with growls so piercing you'd think he'd transformed into a savage beast.","Dec 12, 2000"

Splendid,60,"Less cohesively engaging than March on Electric Children, Burn, Piano Island, Burn is, by turns, spasmodically inviting and gratingly repulsive to all but the most patient of noisemongers.","Dec 12, 2000"
Stylus Magazine,50,"The Blood Brothers pretty much have one speed: murder. This will tire even the most patient ears after about fifteen minutes, although, the album does show signs of expanded musical breadth with slower, albeit, brief melodic interludes and unconventional instrumentation (xylophones, toy pianos).","Dec 12, 2000"

Uncut,60,"At several points... the duo belatedly attempts to revivie its peak period formula, but... it's as old-fashioned as a Lollapalooza 1992 T-shirt. Fortunately, Jourgenson and Barker's new ideas are better. [#14, p.140]","Jun 20, 2000"
