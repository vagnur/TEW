AllMusic,75,"The sassy girl-power proclamations and gleefully unsubtle double-entendres that elevated the groups 2015 debut, Reflection, are largely pushed aside for mid-tempos about romance and intimacy. Deep, vulnerable, personal--these were some of the quintets stated goals for 7/27. Its not a bad look by any means.","Sep 16, 2016"

Boston Globe,60,"The second Fifth Harmony LP isn't a massive step forward, but with a constant bombardment of hooks, high energy and incredible harmony there's not much time to catch your breath to compare.","Sep 16, 2016"

Entertainment Weekly,83,"While the hooks may not be as irresistible as her 2014 double whammy of Problem and Break Free, Grande compensates by having something meaningful to say with that jaw-dropping voice.","May 27, 2016"
Los Angeles Times,80,"Its not only the consistent songwriting clout that elevates this album from recent efforts by Grandes teen-star peers, Demi Lovato and Selena Gomez. Even if most of it is co-written, the modish message of empowerment feels honest coming from Grande.","May 27, 2016"
AllMusic,80,"While some of these cuts work better than others, the range is impressive, as is Grande's measured, assured performance.","May 27, 2016"

Entertainment Weekly,76,"Even if the results are uneven at times. Grande does not need to force any sort of spirit, she is full of it already. She just needs to find the Dangerous Woman within herself and let her break free.","May 27, 2016"
New Musical Express (NME),75,"Dangerous Woman shouldnt be taken particularly seriously as any kind of maturation, but that it still has some pretty good songs on it. Not counting the bonus tracks, there are only two outright throwaways.","May 27, 2016"

The Observer (UK),70,"She appears to be in the right place creatively, but she just needs to take her own advice and break free.","May 27, 2016"
Boston Globe,70,"Though the album immediately shifts gears with the decidedly more contemporary title track, a sultry waltz in which the singer implores her man to test [her] limits, assuring him that, underneath, every 21-century woman is a bad girl, there are smart, unexpected nods to yesteryear throughout the remainder of Dangerous Woman.","May 27, 2016"
Los Angeles Times,60,"These songs [Greedy, Into You and Touch It], which unite a strong persona--haughty, insatiable, a little manic, really into you--with a vivid pocket version of one style or another, are the core of a swift, heedless pop album, albeit one struggling to emerge from the false notes (Dangerous Woman) and rote 2016 obligations (Future) of whats probably an executive-mandated bagginess.","May 27, 2016"

Drowned In Sound,91,"While hes done nearly a dozen yesteryear-based solo albums, this one is distinguished by its smartly chosen representation of the Gershwins musical breadth and the handpicked, multi-stylistic band (with Mickey Raphaels winsome yet penetrating harmonica again providing a crucial link to Willies larger body of work) fittingly snazzing up the affair while making the most of Willies no-dress-code musical fusion.","Apr 22, 2016"

Boston Globe,85,"Emotion goes to great lengths to prove the advantages of being manufactured, with every piece interlocking with machine-like precision with its surroundings.

NOW Magazine,75,"Turning gives everyone a chance to be himself or herself-and to be celebrated for it.","Mar 24, 2015"
Mojo,73,"This is, to date, his quintessential live release, capturing a set that toggles carefully between the bands luxurious sounds and his urgent songs.
