No Ripcord,100,"By taking various elements from not only their collective past, but also the work they've done separately, Radiohead has created something wholly new and utterly entrancing.","May  8, 2016"
Pretty Much Amazing,100,"A Moon Shaped Pool is the best album we could expect from a rock outfit already into its third decade of existence, and a superb work from the last important band left in the universe.","May  8, 2016"
DIY Magazine,100,"Beyond anything, A Moon Shaped Pool feels like the beginning of a new chapter--the first time these five have merged their own idiosyncrasies without compromising or crossing wires.","May  8, 2016"
Entertainment Weekly,100,"By nature, Radiohead albums will always be somewhat epic, but this one is more consistently grandiose than any of the bands releases since 2000s masterpiece Kid A.","May  8, 2016"
The Telegraph (UK),100,"Radiohead's most melodically accessible collection, almost meditative in its ethereal mid-tempo loveliness, yet shot through with the kind of edgy details that never quite let a listener relax. It is chill-out music to put your nerves on edge.","May  8, 2016"
The Line of Best Fit,95,"Embodying that impervious inner spirit that Kafka called the Indestructible, where the possibility of perfect happiness exists in spite of everything else, its calm resignation defines what A Moon Shaped Pool strives for. In honing that potential from start to finish, Radiohead have excavated their most accomplished album in at least 15 years.","May  8, 2016"
Paste Magazine,92,"Unlike Limbs, Pool never strains by adhering to a methodology. It just feels like a collection of songsvery fucking transportive songs.","May  8, 2016"

The 405,90,"Very few records are able to transport the listener to a different world full of visceral, palpable feeling for even just one listen. A Moon Shaped Pool manages to do it over and over again with the feelings deepening rather than cheapening with each successive listen.","May  8, 2016"
Slant Magazine,90,"While A Moon Shaped Pool offers little in the way of new sonic territory, its newly naked and incisive portrayal of emotional vulnerability remains a resoundingly major achievement.","May  8, 2016"
American Songwriter,90,"For a long time now, Radiohead has been achieving mesmerizing results by blazing the trail for synthetic sounds in rock and roll. But its the humanity, oh, the humanity, that makes A Moon Shaped Pool so moving.","May  8, 2016"
Spin,90,"Somehow, Pool transmutes fatigue and anxiety into a hallucinatory magick thats far more cathartic than a jacuzzi soak or a glass of wine. Its Radiohead doing Radiohead on a molecular level, via controlled burns. Their weary indifference to us becomes our transcendence.","May  8, 2016"

Clash Music,80,"It probably wont satisfy those who still yearn for a return to their 90s alt-rock beginnings but its a good starting point for newcomers. For the rest of us though, what this all amounts to, in the end, is another fantastic Radiohead album.","May  8, 2016"
The Observer (UK),80,"Radiohead have long trafficked in existential dread and political anger, and in a wider sense of twitchy bereftness that bends to fit any number of scenarios  their very own aural shade of Yves Klein blue, maybe, just a little more bruised. This arresting ninth album is bathed in it.","May  8, 2016"
The Skinny,80,"Its the soundtrack to our most outlandish dreams, perhaps the exit music to the unmade film of our most romantic lives. If you're still to discover Radiohead, listen to this, for it's the perfect way in.","May  8, 2016"
AllMusic,80,"Radiohead is recognizably the same band that made that pioneering piece of electronica-rock but they're older and wiser on A Moon Shaped Pool, deciding not to push at the borders of their sound but rather settle into the territory they've marked as their own. This may not result in a radical shift in sound but rather a welcome change in tone: for the first time Radiohead feels comfortable in their own skin.","May  8, 2016"
Exclaim,80,"That lack of tension and urgency throughout stops A Moon Shaped Pool from being a classic on par with Radiohead's best work, but then, perhaps that's the wrong standard to reasonably hold an album that trades the band's trademark anxiety for acceptance, their experimentalism for elegance.","May  8, 2016"
New Musical Express (NME),80,"An album of eerie, elusive beauty.","May  8, 2016"
Drowned In Sound,80,"It is a formidably layered, beautiful record that largely lacks big hooks or aggressive bite, and yet conspires to be endlessly satisfying on a micro level, a clutch of ballads that represent the band's most intricate musical trip.","May  8, 2016"
Los Angeles Times,80,"An album that reaches for something far more organic and immediate [than 2011's The King Of Limbs].","May  8, 2016"
The Independent (UK),80,"Drawing on the embattled, hopeful possibilities of early Seventies soul, rock and folk, its chamber-classical and folk instrumentation allows for pleasure as well as despair. This is a Radiohead album to make you feel, better.","May  8, 2016"
The New York Times,80,"Grim tidings arrive amid gorgeous backdrops ... The results often hark back to the late 1960s; in a way, 'A Moon Shaped Pool' is Radioheads psych-folk album.","May  8, 2016"
The Guardian,80,"Its not an album that feels lost in experimentation. The abundance of sonic intrigue is matched by the quantity of beautiful tunes.","May  8, 2016"
Resident Advisor,78,"Following shaky albums from both Yorke and Radiohead, A Moon Shaped Pool suggests that they were right to keep the faith.","May  8, 2016"
The A.V. Club,75,"It pauses, in awkward fits and starts, even as the overall experience is languid and repetitive, like the daily grind of life itself. The band has figured out how to translate its worldview into an album of tone poems, a record of songs ending in abrupt drops or trailed-off codas, as though each effort--by definition, you get the sense--must inevitably come up short.","May  8, 2016"
Chicago Tribune,75,"A casual listen or two might consign A Moon Shaped Pool to the latest in a series of Radiohead releases post-Kid A (2000) that are more about texture and arty experimentation than guitar rock or pop structure. But as with most Radiohead releases, theres something more going on.","May  8, 2016"
Tiny Mix Tapes,70,"A Moon Shaped Pool is a grower, because all music is a grower. Here, there is perhaps a wider opportunity for the music to grow due to there being an audible release of sign and substance as a ghostly after-image of the bands event-based trauma.","May  8, 2016"
Sputnikmusic,70,"It makes for one of Radiohead's most personal efforts, but also an elusive one. Yorke often loses himself to the point of losing others. Those able to ride in his emotional wake will be captivated--those by the curb will forget A Moon Shaped Pool like the receding tide.","May  8, 2016"
Classic Rock Magazine,60,"Sporadically great but decidedly patchy, A Moon Shaped Pool is not the sound of a great band dying, more a great band spreading themselves too thinly.","May  8, 2016"
NOW Magazine,60,"There are moments where the restraint feels almost too determined, as though the abundance of care and attention to subtle detail also places a cap on the kind of impulsive energy essential to a rock-oriented band.","May  8, 2016"
The Quietus,40,"Theres simply so little spark here, barely glowing embers and blackened dust where once Radiohead blazed a fascinating, furious trail for others to attempt to follow.","May  8, 2016"

Drowned In Sound,90,"An album-long search for new ways to express old thoughts, and far from any prescribed formula of tempos and buggery that would entail techno or drum n bass or other electronic information media.","Jul 31, 2015"

New Musical Express (NME),80,"Gemma and Sophie Bakerwood and Louise Croft exploring electronica, with deep synth tones, crunching glitch and, on Divided By Surfaces And Silence and Skip To The End, flickers of drum n bass. Wordless, sighing vocals grace the semi-acoustic techno of Hearts Not Parts, the trios voices rushing through the gaps in the instrumental wash.","Jul 31, 2015"
The Line of Best Fit,75,"If this all sounds a bit linear, as though Etch and Etch Deep moves like a standard plot, well, thats because it does. Theres no film to accompany it, but that doesnt mean Haiku Saluts second album doesnt make for a fantastic score, providing a subtle emotional guide as it moves from point A to point B and each stop along the way.","Jul 31, 2015"

Drowned In Sound,80,"For longtime fans, a dubbed-out Grace Jones begets an exotic retelling of her myth, like painting a Sherman tank in watercolours - sure it's pretty, but under those runny dub brushstokes is hidden a killing machine.","Sep  6, 2011"

Slant Magazine,80,"It may sound beside the point to exclaim that Jones sounds as good as she looks, or vice versa, but she's always been as attentive to her image as her performance, so I don't think she'd take issue with me praising Hurricane by calling it as lean, mean, and close to the bone as she herself remains.","Sep  6, 2011"

Pitchfork,75,"Hurricane is classic Jones.","Sep  6, 2011"
Consequence of Sound,70,"All in all, Hurricane is a worthy collection of music for Jones at this point of her career; we should hope it's the start of a new era for the icon rather than just a one-off release.","Sep  6, 2011"
New Musical Express (NME),70,"In revisiting the production of her '80s records she paradoxically produces something that sounds timeless.","Sep  6, 2011"
Dot Music,70,"While never as life-changing as these memories clearly were, Hurricane succeeds in its sheer force of conviction.","Sep  6, 2011"
AllMusic,60,"Although Guest's interpretations work well as an accompaniment piece, it's the return-to-form original (also included here in its entirety) which remains the more essential listen.","Sep  6, 2011"
PopMatters,60,"It's good enough to warrant the inevitable 'return to form' and 'comeback' labels, good enough to make you appreciate Jones all over again. Take a step back, though, and it is far from perfect. At times it escapes embarrassment by the skin of its teeth.","Sep  6, 2011"

Delusions of Adequacy,80,"Condors, is a restless, richly-detailed amalgam of intricate, glitchy electronic ambience, guitar reverberations that range from gently acoustic to furiously rockin', and ethereal to keening female vocals that recall Kazu Makino of Blonde Redhead, Nicole Barille of mr.

New Musical Express (NME),60,"There's two sides to Nedry. One is given to taking faintly voguish reference points, lopping off the sharp edges and smoothing out the kinks.

The A.V. Club,83,"Most of the music on Deer Tick's third album, The Black Dirt Sessions, was recorded back in 2008, during the sessions for the rollicking Born On Flag Day, but it'd be a mistake to think of these songs as leftovers.","Jun  8, 2010"

cokemachineglow,75,"While not punch-for-punch or track-for-track the heavy-hitter 'War Elephant' was, or even offering the tonal variety of 'Born on Flag Day,' the consistency has come into its own doleful focus, the lyrics have reached a blisteringly high point and for any/all flaws, and, in the end, it just leaves me holding the broken pieces of my face in my fucking hands.","Jun  8, 2010"

Billboard.com,88,"Displaying impressive vocal polish from outspoken frontman Scott Weiland; blazing guitar solos over tight, crunch-laden instrumentation; and grungy takes on Lennon/McCartney melodicism, STP asserts its place among seminal hard-rock chameleons.","May 25, 2010"
Entertainment Weekly,83,"Scott Weiland sounds downright effervescent on the first Stone Temple Pilots disc in nearly a decade. There's nothing new here, just cheap and easy pop-rock mimicry (the Beatles, Petty, Nirvana, Bowie, Aerosmith), siphoned through spry, crunchy grunge riffs.","May 25, 2010"

cokemachineglow,65,"Said new record is what one would expect: wholly similar to their first three records in that its got three possible hit singles, a useless Side B, and is proudly derivative of at least six other bands.

Clash Music,60,"Still, for as remote and guarded as Thorn comes off in these 10 vaguely embittered tunes (two of which are covers: 'Come on Home to Me' and 'You Are a Lover'), and for as sparse and reserved as their arrangements are, there remains one connective thread between this and Thorn's lullabies of clubland: She still summons drama with just the force of her voice.","May 18, 2010"

Boston Globe,70,"Higher Than the Eiffel is most reminiscent of the work that Freestylers and Lo-Fidelity Allstars were doing eight to ten years ago.

The New York Times,70,"In general, though, when the Bullys have their sights set on the dancefloor, whether it be a drug fueled downer house anthem or a colossal electro groove, they seem most at home.

Drowned In Sound,78,"Even if Sea of Cowards sounds more bashed-out than labored-over, it works. It's a heavy, snarly, physical rock album, and it feels like the work of people so secure in their ass-kicking abilities that they don't have to sweat the details.","May 11, 2010"
musicOMH.com,75,"Sea Of Cowards storms through 11 songs in 35 minutes, and while few of those songs are memorable in and of themselves, the album as a whole has a spontaneity and ferocity that makes it a fleetingly thrilling half-hour of throwback rock.","May 11, 2010"
Mojo,70,"It could have easily gone into darker, scarier narratives and/or sonic atmospheres but they shut it down at the near three-minute mark. Unnecessary brevity is a sticking point: Sea Of Cowards' 11 tracks run a little over 35 minutes.","May 11, 2010"
Los Angeles Times,70,"Sea of Cowards works hard to dispel those not-unjustified notions of The Dead Weather being Jack Whites third-best band.

Spin,70,"So, yes, Sea of Cowards is something of a jumble. But it's an entirely ecstatic one.

Absolute Punk (Staff reviews),80,"Latin doesn't have a weak moment, and while LP's higher energy levels may indeed play better with that lucrative Top Shop demographic, it would seem remarkable if any right thinking fan of the band didn't think Latin at least its equal.","May 11, 2010"

BBC Music,80,"Latin, the band's third album, is something of a side-step from its predecessors, Holy Fuck (2004) and LP (2007). It's less brawny and statelier, perhaps in part due to its producers Paul Epworth (Florence, The Rapture) and Dave Sardy (Black Mountain, LCD).

Dot Music,70,"The sheer scope of 'Latin', however, is what rescues it from feeling like a box-ticking completion of a mission--as 'P.I.G.S.' races off into the distance after its lull, there's the feeling that there might still be more to see, more work to be done.","May 11, 2010"

Urb,50,"In striving rather openly to set their sophomore effort apart from what they view as the critically acclaimed trappings of their debut, MGMT offers what is, essentially, an album of B-sides--a few bright spots strung together with half-baked concepts and monotony, in need of a lot less knob-tweaking and a whole lot more rewrites.","Apr 13, 2010"
Pitchfork,50,"There are nine tracks of somewhat forgettable spacey-psych 70's songs that are packed with confusion from start to finish. It sounds as if the band skipped a few pages, assuming that their immediate debut success would carry over with the risks they took for this one.","Apr 13, 2010"

Urb,80,"While it's hardly the stark, across-the-board tonal sea change suggested by several of its most immediately ear-catching cuts, And Then We Saw Land is at once an adventurous outward journey and an invitingly familiar return from an always intriguing, intrepid, and under-heralded band.","Apr  6, 2010"

Tiny Mix Tapes,60,"The end result is an album that would be fine as a first effort--that is, if it did not naturally have to be compared to previous Tunng albums.","Apr  6, 2010"
Q Magazine,58,"No one should begrudge them their cleaner, smoother sound, but straight-laced songwriting has sapped the band's well-worn eccentricities.

BBC Music,90,"I Speak Because I Can is an album of elegance and brilliance. Marling has developed from her debut, and her voice has grown both physically and lyrically.","Apr  6, 2010"
Mojo,90,"What makes Marling engaging is that her music presents scenarios without deliberately sounding like poetry or art. Her songs do not emphasize the beauty of sounds or musicality of words so much as clip insightful observations from conversations.","Apr  6, 2010"
musicOMH.com,89,"She found it in herself to make yet another gorgeous, melancholy, old-souled record.","Apr  6, 2010"

Q Magazine,81,"Her sophomore effort, I Speak Because I Can, finds Marling, still only 20, shrugging off virtually all traces of girlishness and wide-eyed charm, instead delving into darkly elemental, frequently morbid folk. And yet, astonishingly, the expected growing pains never come.","Apr  6, 2010"
AllMusic,80,"With I Speak Because I Can, that argument may now end. Though just 20, it doesn't appear within her scope to make an outright bad album, and here we are shown a few more glimpses of her gift, but yet not an overwhelming outpouring of it.","Apr  6, 2010"
Drowned In Sound,80,"I Speak Because I Can is, without doubt, an album to really delve into, and one to lose yourself in for hours. Added to that, it asserts Marling as one of this country's most talented young songwriters; our Conor Oberst or our David Berman.","Apr  6, 2010"

Prefix Magazine,70,"I Speak Because I Can is composed of mature, sophisticated but relatable songs, performed as only Marling can perform them, showcasing not only a broader vocal range and more intricate guitar parts than on her previous album, but a new breadth of experience, resulting in a balanced album that can sound as enshrouded in shadow as it does enlightened.","Apr  6, 2010"

AllMusic,70,"That the result is largely 'light' listening works against it to a degree, but the idea that such a sound was entirely Byrne's intent forgives even this. It's not often that a purely musical work can make us see a historical figure in a new light, but Here Lies Love is a fascinating exception.","Apr  6, 2010"
Boston Globe,63,"On his collaboration with Fatboy Slim (a.k.a. Norman Cook) on the story of Imelda Marcos, Here Lies Love: A Song Cycle About Imelda Marcos & Estrella Cumpas, Byrne gets bogged down in the fertile ground of his boundless imagination.","Apr  6, 2010"
Spin,61,"With multiple narrators voiced by a plethora of singers, it's hard to follow which character is speaking at any given time. Extensive liner notes clear up the confusion, but it feels like a lot of work for an album that's not particularly revelatory in either music or story.","Apr  6, 2010"
PopMatters,60,"The hitch in the album is the hit-or-miss probability of the listener connecting with the quizzical story, wrought in obscurity.","Apr  6, 2010"

American Songwriter,60,"The roster's promising and the concept is offbeat enough to be brilliant. The execution? It could have been a lot more inspired.

Boston Globe,50,"Both Byrne and Fatboy Slim have built careers on beats, the imperative of activating the hips as much as the brain, and they touch on everything from salsa to Philadelphia soul on Here Lies Love.

Entertainment Weekly,40,"Marcos' life was all luxury and color, but the songs don't translate. Here Lies Love will play in gay clubs, but for a collaboration between forward-thinkers like Byrne and Cook, it's pretty safe while also having no direction.","Apr  6, 2010"

The lively accordion and clanky piano on the song 'Shadow People' recall Bob Dylan's 1974 country-folk single 'Forever Young,' but the cheerfulness seems to contradict Dr. Dog guitarist/vocalist Scott McMicken's strained lyric: 'It's the right time for the wrong company.'","Apr  6, 2010"
Under The Radar,70,"With co-producer Rob Schnapf at the helm, Dr. Dog don't sound like mere imitators--they sound like an unusually hook-savvy indie band whose taut, touching songs about friendship ('Jackie Wants a Black Eye') and life on the road ('Station') begin as straight pop rock and take thrilling turns into psychedelia.","Apr  6, 2010"

AllMusic,67,"Portions of Shame, Shame might prove to be just a little too effervescent--certainly not a bad thing for a band with a track record that usually ran contrary.

Rolling Stone,72,"Maybe it's the presence of guitarist Marc Ribot, maybe it's the arrangements, or maybe it's Dylan's vocal register and choice of themes, but the vibe often recalls a more laid-back Tom Waits or Joe Henry.

The Boston Phoenix,70,"Javelin don't yet possess the same kind of wit and invention of their most obvious forbearers, but there's enormous potential here, and the biggest compliment that can be paid to No Ms is that it will sound best when reduced down to an audio tape and shoved into one of the boomboxes that Langford and van Buskirk so slavishly worship.","Apr  6, 2010"

Mojo,75,"Mostly, though, I Will Be is a flawlessly light album that floats to the top of a lo-fi pond overcrowded with sinking debris.","Mar 30, 2010"
Under The Radar,70,"On the whole, I Will Be invites you to be whisked along by the sheer energy burst: the potsnpans clatter of the drums, the crackle and fizz from the amps and the bitter take on romance from Dee Dee herself.","Mar 30, 2010"
AllMusic,70,"The Dum Dum Girls debut, I Will Be, plays like a veritable best-of of current trends in lo-fi rock n' pop. In fact, the discs (admittedly exhilarating) fidelity to the budding-but-already-overdone genre nearly weighs it down.","Mar 30, 2010"
Drowned In Sound,70,"Its anachronistic, fashionable and sometimes quite beautiful. Its teen music for adults. Its also incredibly sentimental.","Mar 30, 2010"

Paste Magazine,80,"Where Vol. 1 presented shorter versions of singles from their earliest incarnation and shaped them into a seamless full-length, this set is different in approach and sound, though no less worthy.

Billboard.com,80,"While there will always be the criticism that a Wooden Shjips record is a merely an acquired taste of familiar morsels, the ripened fruits within never fail to satisfy the palette on every count, and even though some of Vol. 2 may be three years old, its a more than worthy addition to anyone's sonic menu.","Mar 16, 2010"

cokemachineglow,63,"You'd be forgiven for expecting little more than fan-bait out of a release that gathers the band's between-album singles and rarities.

Slant Magazine,70,"The band's third disc is the sharpest distillation of its neo-college rock yet, with Animal Collective producer Ben H. Allen's arty, wall-of-sound approach brightening singer-guitarist Parker Gispert's underdog anthems while rarely slowing them down.","Mar 16, 2010"
PopMatters,70,"The Whigs absorbed every rock trend of the '90s, consciously taking in the cool stuff while the mainstream tunes seeped in, and here they turn In the Dark into something that's a guilty pleasure for anyone raised on grunge.","Mar 16, 2010"

Paste Magazine,58,"At times, Parker Gispert's voice is buffed clean of any individual characteristics; at other times, it's contorted into a hackneyed imitation of Southern rockers such as Jim James. The album's best moments, unsurprisingly, are those in which the band lays off the mixing knobs.","Mar 16, 2010"
PopMatters,50,"In the Dark is an excessively fundamental album (guitars, drums, and bass, chorus-verse-chorus-that's all there), and viscerally, it's not too offensive.","Mar 16, 2010"
Prefix Magazine,40,"You could call it 'rock on autopilot'. It would be a good description. If you asked some space creatures to create an album of banal Earthling arena rock, they might very well create In the Dark using a tentacleful of the simplest mathematical algorithms.","Mar 16, 2010"

New Musical Express (NME),36,"While the songs certainly do the Whigs no favors, the production and mixing on Dark are downright unconscionable, making one long for the relative restraint of Don Gilmore or Andy Wallace.","Mar 16, 2010"
Mojo,30,"In the Dark is a big, loud, dumb record, filled with songs about not respecting women you bang on the bus ('Someone's Daughter'), feeling empty inside ('So Lonely' and 'I Don't Even Care About The One I Love') and being for real ('I Am For Real').","Mar 16, 2010"
AllMusic,20,"This is not an observation about theme--the record is unremarkable in both sound and execution.","Mar 16, 2010"

No Ripcord,87,"The album sounds ridiculously heavy, with many songs-- including the gurgling 'I'm Slowly Turning Into You' and the Dusty Springfield cover 'I Just Don't Know What to Do With Myself'-- easily trumping their studio counterparts.","Mar 16, 2010"
Under The Radar,80,"The live album is built from tracks taken from different shows so doesnt show off the improvisatory nature of their setlist-free shows, but again, its a reminder that their three-year absence is a bit of a tragedy.","Mar 16, 2010"

Austin Chronicle,80,"Since a big part of the Stripes live show also rests on their visuals, the Under Great White Northern Lights DVD gives the complete experience, but this album is satisfying enough to make it a must for most fans.","Mar 16, 2010"
The Guardian,70,"Under Great White Northern Lights would be a funny postscript. It's not particularly revelatory, less cohesive a concert film that Under Blackpool Lights, and in no way intimates that the band was about to go into hiatus. Really, it serves, more than anything else, as a reminder of just how singularly odd the White Stripes are, and how boring things are without them around.","Mar 16, 2010"
AllMusic,70,"Northern Lights captures the live show as circus, the aura where group participation and the raggedness of improvisation supersedes a faithful rendering of songs, an interpretation that, if not always satisfying to listen to, is at least fascinating to behold.","Mar 16, 2010"
BBC Music,63,"But right down to the tongue-in-cheek stage patter (My names Jack White and this is my big sister Meg White on the drums!) theres nothing here that White Stripes fans havent heard before.","Mar 16, 2010"

Drowned In Sound,60,"Ultimately, like many live albums before them and certainly after them, it's just okay.

Q Magazine,50,"The sold-separately CD soundtrack reiterates that point, capturing the pair's post-millennium blues, from the scat-rap, tornado groove of 'Icky Thump' and electric mandolin haunt 'Little Ghost' to the proto-punk, Maximum R&B of 'Let's Shake Hands.'","Mar 16, 2010"

cokemachineglow,70,"For the most part, though, the songs are spilled out softly in McRae's high, honey-coated voice, and are centered around humble-but-plaintive acoustic guitar and piano patterns.

XLR8r,40,"For fans of those unabashedly earnest and heartfelt records that was filling up the charts between grunge singles nearly 15 to 20 years ago, Alphabet might come as a needed relief from todays bearded, lo-fidelity folk stars spewing abstract poetics.

Tiny Mix Tapes,90,"Wolfs elastic compositions straddle the line between a multitude of genres without making it sound forced. Widely respected as one of the best drummers on the indie scene for years, Josiah Wolf has deftly proven he has the chops to stand on his own.","Mar  9, 2010"
Under The Radar,78,"Jet Lag is a confident, mature, fully-realized record, and much denser than it lets on.","Mar  9, 2010"
PopMatters,70,"Jet Lag is a modest slice of lonesome lo-fi indie folk as they used to make it back when the para-Pavement galaxy was still busy splintering into its constituent planets, the ruminative Bermans and the verbose Pollards and the melodically off-kilter Barlows.","Mar  9, 2010"
BBC Music,70,"Whilst at times the melodies feel frail, and it seems to struggle with a slight lack of something musically, at others the album is triumphant, with complex, brilliant pop songs about that age old theme, heartbreak.","Mar  9, 2010"
Q Magazine,60,"The stylistic similarities are pretty undeniable, and not necessarily to Josiah's advantage--but the elder Wolf has enough of a distinct voice (and enough to say with it) that Why?'s fans will definitely want to give it a listen--and those who find Yoni a bit too dizzyingly cerebral might take more kindly to Josiah's sincerity and directness.","Mar  9, 2010"
Slant Magazine,60,"Skull In The Ice is an exception; perhaps the most tender of all the songs, it begins with a stripped-down strum and evolves in the chorus with luscious, rich surroundings.

No Ripcord,56,"Lyrically, Wolf is convincing when sticking to the grief-stricken script. It's when he goes off-book that things start to get awkward.","Mar  9, 2010"

Prefix Magazine,100,"Only behind such a distracting smokescreen could Damon Albarn get away with conducting a project as sprawling, daring, innovative, surprising, muddled and magnificent as Plastic Beach: not just one of the best records of 2010, but a release to stand alongside the greatest Albarns ever been involved with and a new benchmark for collaborative music as a whole.","Mar  9, 2010"

Boston Globe,88,"Plastic Beach is a full blown hip-hop/trip-hop album and a prime example of how to stray away from one genre to dominate another. If Albarn has done anything with this project, he has shown his knowledge of flawless production and the ability to create aesthetically pleasing tunes.","Mar  9, 2010"
Tiny Mix Tapes,85,"He never panders to them; instead, Plastic Beach's guest vocals are anchored by Albarn's own melodic flair. His falsettoed ennui shines through, and the songs are loaded with Albarn's pet sounds.","Mar  9, 2010"

Clash Music,80,"Not all of Plastic Beach's concoctions work. It's a moot point as to whether the fake jingle of Superfast Jellyfish, featuring De La Soul and Gruff Rhys, is daffily entertaining or just annoying beyond belief--but there's something hugely impressive about Albarn's ability to coax artists out of their comfort zone.","Mar  9, 2010"
Rolling Stone,80,"From the languid, early Bowie dreaminess of Empire Ants to the chilled-out fuzz-funk of Stylo, featuring a startling eruptive vocal from the legendary Bobby Womack, Plastic Beach captivates.","Mar  9, 2010"

AllMusic,75,"Sometimes, especially in the album's latter half, that sonic drift can come off as dull, and even dispiriting. Often, though, they do it with style.","Mar  9, 2010"
RapReviews.com,75,"The result is an album that is slightly less immediate--the instant appeal of a hit such as Clint Eastwood or Feel Good Inc. is lacking. Bobby Womacks strident vocal on Stylo is a rare burst of exuberance, but much of the rest exudes a chilled charm.","Mar  9, 2010"
Under The Radar,75,"With synth tones straight outta Miami Vice and dreamy melodies that cut through the fog-machine haze, Plastic Beach is music for piloting your speedboat beyond the no-wake zone, or for looking back from the future with a sentimental affinity for the past.","Mar  9, 2010"
Mojo,75,"While there's no immediate pop hit present a la 'Feel Good Inc' or 'Clint Eastwood' to get sucked into straight off, Albarn's ability to juggle his rotating ensemble cast and still spin a cohesive yarn for all of sixteen tracks remains something to behold.","Mar  9, 2010"
The New York Times,70,"Best when hes corralling others into out-of-their-comfort-zone creativity, its the Albarn-sung tracks on the second half of the album where the attention wanders and the album opening Snoop Dogg cameo seems a million miles away. Of course, theres alot here to take in and maybe it just needs a fair few listens to fully digest it - the sign of any album worth its salt.","Mar  9, 2010"
Sputnikmusic,70,"Plastic Beach proves that he's most truly himself when he turns into a cartoon.","Mar  9, 2010"
Austin Chronicle,70,"It's a jumble. But Albarn's love of 'Waterloo Sunset' poignancy adds emotional weight.","Mar  9, 2010"
Los Angeles Times,70,"Overall, while the album isnt an artistic triumph or grand satirical gesture, it is an enjoyable ride and is the best place to start if you just want a taste of Albarns post-Blur musical prowess and Hewletts animation wizardry.","Mar  9, 2010"
AllMusic,70,"Ironically, these individual pieces dont add up to an overall masterpiece, possibly because the narrative is convoluted and strained, getting in the way of the pure musical flow, but also because its hard not to shake the feeling that this is a transitional effort, pointing toward a day when Damon Albarn will feel no need to front a band, not even in a cartoon guise.","Mar  9, 2010"
BBC Music,70,"Songs like 'Glitter Freeze' push that envelope to its furthest extent, where Albarn's sound becomes a plastic trance dance more at home with pulsing dancefloor strobe lights than a booming club with a DJ spinning the hottest rap hits. That may be a step too far for some. Tracks like 'White Flag' and 'Cloud of Unknowing' walk the line between those extremes.","Mar  9, 2010"

The Boston Phoenix,83,"Referencing everything from OMDs Dazzle Ships (on the Speak-&-Spell-esque Apple For A Brain) to Tears For Fears The Hurting (on the digital-acoustic Gray Death), Stewart and Seo have twisted an admittedly dated retro-synth chic into something far more evocative and, yes, progressive.","Feb 23, 2010"

Filter,90,"Theres good reason for both the length of the album and its occasional lavish moments.

The Boston Phoenix,75,"Like Liam Lynch, Green has a knack for sizing up a genre and spitting out a tongue-in-cheek ditto thats as entertaining as it is naggingly inconsequential, but Minor Loves songs feel a little heftier than usualor maybe he just finally struck the right balance of tenderness and tastelessness.","Feb 16, 2010"
Alternative Press,70,"The album, in general, is much more relaxed than anything Reed created (post-Nico, that is), and while the whole thing has a vaguely hazed-out feel, the effect created is more stoner chill than frenetic heroin-induced madness","Feb 16, 2010"

Mojo,70,"Alternating meticulous power pop ('Measure') and anxious aloofness ('Let's Write a Book') with relaxed twang ('Clear Water') and pliant balladry ('Curves of the Needle'), the Brewises seek a certain balance on Measure.

Mojo,60,"The Constant is best when going fast and loud, keeping your heart racing (and your mind off the subpar lyrics), but it loses momentum with cookie cutter ballad 'holding On To You and a track, 'Remember A Time,' that oddly sounds more like Weezer than Warped Tour.

Spin,60,"Whether or not one enjoys Presidence depends largely on whether this practice resonates; and resonance is a highly contingent, subjective process.

Pitchfork,30,"Pursuing new directions and seeking out new sonic soundscapes is all very well, as is jamming and wailing for 30 minutes and holding 17 hour gigs.

Alternative Press,80,"Odd Blood peaks in the middle, with two marvelous extended tracks which take the raw materials of '80s soul and funk and somehow manage to inject the mesmeric, insistent rhythms of Krautrock without making a terrible mess of things.","Feb  9, 2010"
Rock Sound,80,"The biggest, boldest, and best moments on their second album nod flamboyantly to influences never before evident -- Erasure ('Ambling Alp') and Haircut 100 (the tropical 'O.N.E.'), among others -- but somehow they're seamlessly integrated with trippier old jams.","Feb  9, 2010"
Q Magazine,80,"I wasn't sure whether to listen to the record or call Ghostbusters. But once I plumped for the former, I was somewhat shocked to discover a pop record, full of grooves, melodies and recognisable chorus type-affairs.","Feb  9, 2010"
Revolver,80,"The new sound features a dense, Dave Fridmann-like production: pumping, parping, squelching sounds familiar to those from The Flaming Lips, or MGMT, but rarely coupled to such strong hooks, or vocal performances, by either.","Feb  9, 2010"

Dusted Magazine,80,"The result is simultaneously stranger and poppier, more celebratory and more serious.","Feb  9, 2010"
Drowned In Sound,80,"An unfamiliar listener coming in cold to Yeasayers second full-length album probably wouldnt make it too much further than the opener, The Children. Its a choppy, dirge-like downer, the soundtrack to a spooky submarines descent into the abyss in cinematic slow motion.

Observer Music Monthly,70,"So yeah, maaaaybe Odd Blood isnt quite the hive of unfathomably exotic treats that a few of the tracks might have initially suggested. Having given us time to prepare for the fact theyre quite the different band from All Hour Cymbals, Yeasayer Mk II have also given us time to realise that Odd Blood probably isnt likely to go down as their defining statement.","Feb  9, 2010"

Rolling Stone,70,"While it almost goes without staying that every bands aspiration is to ingeniously pique the interest of their listeners by reinventing old elements and coupling them with new and creative tones, it seems this records goal is not necessarily to go without saying, but say it all in the fewest possible breaths.","Feb  9, 2010"

Billboard.com,65,"Throughout its padded 40-minute run time (like 'All Hour Cymbals,' its got a decent amount of filler), Odd Blood makes a stronger case for whats up next for the bands sound than where it is now.","Feb  9, 2010"
AllMusic,61,"It's hard to miss the pressure the band was under to deliver here--it's nearly palpable in their overfed production and search for direction, and as a result, Odd Blood is a bit too much of not enough.","Feb  9, 2010"
Delusions of Adequacy,60,"Odd Blood delivers a series of earworms that are undeniably catchy but leave a legitimate question in their wake: why should we care? Yeasayer ultimately fails to answer this question, and Odd Blood sort of just runs its course unimpressively.","Feb  9, 2010"
Mojo,60,"Its entirely possible that the skillfully-made Odd Blood will find an entirely new bunch of listeners. Many of the old ones, like this writer, will probably just find themselves frustrated.","Feb  9, 2010"
Q Magazine,60,"They seem keen to hold a mirror up to familiar pop tropes, but in doing so only reveal themselves for what they are - a gang of weirdoes carrying guitars. Perversely, their eagerness to engage the mainstream attention span often seems obnoxious in itself.","Feb  9, 2010"
Chicago Tribune,60,"The more tastefully formulated tracks just cant offset the profusion of soppy lyricism and the tedium of weaker songs. Ultimately, Odd Blood reads as a well-informed but poorly executed homage to the 80s.","Feb  9, 2010"

Hot Press,65,"If I lived completely under a rock, I'd say Screamworks, and HIM in general, would hit Twilight tweeners straight in the heart with its dark, dismal and dire themes, but the more mature crowd would see the excessive sentimentality as almost self-parodying.","Feb  8, 2010"
Urb,60,"The material sits within the bands canon well enough to please longtime fans, and listeners looking for some kind of middle ground between Evanescence, late-period Queensrche  and Fall Out Boy will more than likely find a few wicked gems to hang their heads to.","Feb  8, 2010"
Under The Radar,60,"Old-school romantic Ville Valo croons as often as he screams, so that even when aiming for the stylistic median, a bit of local weirdness oozes forth to make Screamworks more interesting than it's designed to be.","Feb  8, 2010"

Billboard.com,70,"While Causers Of This appears lo-fi on a superficial level with its rough, oversaturated sound quality, it's evident that Bundick has achieved a level of familiarity with his tools which goes way beyond awkward, sophomoric fumbling.","Feb  2, 2010"
Absolute Punk (Staff reviews),70,"Pronounced experimentalism is one of the more appealing properties of Bundicks record, while those most tolerant of tepid, early 80s tones will find certain segments easier to swallow than the rest of us.","Feb  2, 2010"

XLR8r,90,"With her songwriting on point (she's always had a weakness for obvious, forced rhymes, but her discovery of slant and blank rhyme leave just a couple such offenders intact) and with her distinctive contralto in exquisite form, Moorer's performance here is arguably a career best.","Feb  2, 2010"

Los Angeles Times,80,"She's not displaying much in the way of stylistic evolution, but it's not exactly certain whether this is a negative factor.

Uncut,90,"Nirvana's headlining gig at the 1992 Reading Festival looms infamously large because of (a) that amazingly creepy photo of Kurt getting wheeled onto the stage looking like Norman Bates' mother, and (b) the show was a mind-blower--sloppy indie rock as stadium-filling psychedelic punk.","Nov  3, 2009"

cokemachineglow,90,"Bleach is freshened up with remastered versions of unusually heavy songs like the haunting 'Negative Creep,' where Cobain howls about alienation and being stoned, and the pounding 'Floyd the Barber,' where the main subject of the eerie track is a man being strapped down and tortured by characters from 'The Andy Griffith Show.","Nov  3, 2009"

Rolling Stone,80,"There's barely a duff track here, from the talking gothic blues of 'The Pill' and the slinky Monks-esque strut of 'Isolation'. Top marks, though, go the pulpit croon of '(Sometimes You Got To Be) Gentle'. [Dec 2009, p. 97]","Oct 20, 2009"

PopMatters,91,"Florence Welch has a penchant for dramatics. But what would be a dubious distinction for most twentysomethings becomes an advantage when paired with Welch's otherworldly vocals and a trio of top-tier British producers who elevate her Mercury Prize-nominated debut album, Lungs, to something that manages to be grandiose, relatable, and incessantly catchy all at the same time.","Oct 20, 2009"

Paste Magazine,80,"From the way she sings, in big gulps and Teen Wolf growls, to the mystical art-rock ballads she bedazzles with sleigh bells, harps, and choirs, there's enough drama here for a Broadway musical. But her delivery is so raw that every mess feels genuine.","Oct 20, 2009"

The Guardian,60,"It's a given that Gutter, like the ex-Pulp sideman's five previous shimmering, sepia-toned solo albums, has moments of heartbreaking beauty.

Delusions of Adequacy,78,"It's not that the record is so unclassifiable--shit is downright pleasant to listen to--as it exudes the confidence to acknowledge its influences and contemporaries with the same convivial grace that has marked Q-Tip's entire career.","Sep  8, 2009"
NOW Magazine,75,"Q-Tip's voice retains its loose, slippery allure, but the disc feels like a worthy experiment abandoned halfway through; it doesn't end so much as nod off.","Sep  8, 2009"
Rolling Stone,75,"Alternately sublime and aimless, Abstract is the sound of an artist evolving on wax, and while the growing pains show, they also help make the music surprisingly resonant.","Sep  8, 2009"

AllMusic,70,"As an album, it's a joy to listen to most of the way through. It's more consistent than 'Amplified,' though not as interesting overall, and both more consistent and more interesting than 'The Renaissance.'","Sep  8, 2009"
PopMatters,67,"Buried at Track 7, the developed rhyme, unkiltered time, unsettling keyboards, and Kenny Garrett sax coda of 'Abstractionisms' deliver what the flowery 'Caring' and the endless 'Do You Dig U?' emphatically do not: the 'brand new sound' the finale only brags about.","Sep  8, 2009"
Q Magazine,63,"Kamaal the Abstract is not a great record by any means. But it is an interesting one, a unique effort by an artist struggling to mesh two disparate musical systems, gambling that inherent internal friction could spark some excitement.","Sep  8, 2009"

cokemachineglow,40,"When Joyners at his best, he can break hearts in the most hopeful way possible; in these moments, he is as reinvigorating as a much-needed cry.

PopMatters,63,"When it's not ripping off Panic, Love Drunk seems to be catering to other mainstream audiences and the hipster crowd.... But once you get past all that, you'll find a few solid pop-rock tunes here.","Aug 25, 2009"
Rolling Stone,60,"This is a much better record than their debut--and that in itself is an impressive feat.","Aug 25, 2009"
Sputnikmusic,60,"If Love Drunk's overall enthusiasm and high-energy pop doesn't win over even the snarkiest of reviewers after a few listens, then they probably don't have a heart. Everyone else will love it anyway. Pop-rock like this is popular for a reason.","Aug 25, 2009"

Billboard.com,80,"The Used have taken the best elements of their previous releases, refined them and delivered the strongest album of their career.","Aug 17, 2009"
AllMusic,68,"The Used pushes boundaries with the frenetic lead single 'Blood on My Hands,' whose video features McCracken as a gleeful, blood-soaked vigilante. But the song doesn't so much reinvent the band's sound as amplify it. Other tracks like 'Sold My Soul' and 'The Best of Me' highlight the Used's knack for crafting brutal yet crowd-pleasing anthems.","Aug 17, 2009"
Rolling Stone,60,"Hooks never mattered to the Used anyway, so having a higher grade of execution helps underscore the Used's point, which ironically just makes the whole thing uglier and harder to take.","Aug 17, 2009"

AllMusic,83,"Their equipment may be largely restricted to percussion, vocals, and the occasional embellishment of keyboard, but their ability to fully eclipse these limitations and create music with a strong improvisational pulse and so much vitality is a no small feat, and proves that they are continuing to experiment in magnificent, dynamic ways.","Aug 11, 2009"

PopMatters,80,"The Snake for the first time is a journey riddled with surprise--that almost nothing can be nailed down or predicted even after the seven-minutes-thirty of closer of 'My Heart' is pure 'lucky dip' stuff.

musicOMH.com,90,"The Bachelor's overall tone reflects a nihilistic view of both romance and humanity, making for an about-face from the relative sunshine of 2007's 'The Magic Position,' and this tone is reflected in some of Wolf's most ambitious, baroque compositions to date.","Jul 28, 2009"
Observer Music Monthly,90,"A rousing vessel in which Wolf has finally had the chance to channel his newfound zany confidence into his most extravagant and captivating record yet.","Jul 28, 2009"
Q Magazine,80,"Wolf's music has always held itself in reverence of a wild, untamed Mother Nature; and while The Bachelor is less organic and unfettered in its sonics than, say, the snap and crackle of Wind In The Wires, its message--to preserve all the things a broadband connection cannot provide for us--is clearer than ever.","Jul 28, 2009"

Slant Magazine,75,"Listeners who are not acquainted with the idiosyncratic vocal stylings of Wolf's Britpop predecessors (think of Bryan Ferry, Dave Gahan and especially Morrissey) might find his singing too over the top to take seriously.

Observer Music Monthly,60,"The Bachelor sounds like another attempt by Wolf to perfect something that he got pretty much right on his first album.","Jul 28, 2009"
No Ripcord,60,"The Bachelor is the work of a hugely fertile imagination, skipping from the aforementioned Celtic folk to electro to glam, but one wonders how much more affecting Wolf might be if the grand passions were calmed down a little, the musical magpie impulses restrained a tad.

AllMusic,60,"This collection of B-sides, recorded over the past few years, is way more put-together than Modest Mouses previous rarities comps, Building Nothing Out Of Something and Sad Sappy Sucker. But it lacks the carefree charm of Isaac Brocks pre-success indie rock experiments.","Jul 21, 2009"

NOW Magazine,100,"What's in here finds the band inventive, unfailingly tuneful, and, rather belying the title, mellowing magnificently with age. [Aug 2009, p.87]","Jul 21, 2009"
New Musical Express (NME),94,"Despite the cries about careerism, they rarely settled into one spot for long, and even when they were correctly perceived to have done so--about one half of The Great Escape really is a Parklife retread--they were still spreading their collective wings on album tracks and B-sides.","Jul 21, 2009"
No Ripcord,80,"while Midlife could have used a heavier dose of this side of Blur, there's not a bad track here, and the set also brings their glorious, epoch-creating single 'Popscene' back into circulation.","Jul 21, 2009"
Slant Magazine,80,"At a safe distance from Britpop's glare, Midlife justly represents Blur as national treasures, as emotionally rich and hungry for progress as ardiohead, only catchier. [Aug 2009, p.116]","Jul 21, 2009"
cokemachineglow,80,"That the group could go from the sneering jauntiness of 'Girls And Boys' to the paranoid anxiety of 'Song 2' with no drop in hook-effectiveness is startling in itself; that it managed to continuously and effortlessly navigate th incomprehensible expanse between The Kinks and Brian Eno is an utterly singular achievement. [Summer 2009, p.94]","Jul 21, 2009"

PopMatters,50,"At 59 and 48 minutes each, with space left to fill on both CDs, the labels lack of curiosity about these more obscure sections of the Blur discography seems negligent.","Jul 21, 2009"

musicOMH.com,60,"The influence of that 1972 double LP can be heard in the similarly homespun production of Under the Covers, Vol. 2 but where Rundgren was open-ended, Sweet neatly ties up every loose end with the care of a pop fetishist, making sure all the harmonies and guitar licks are in place, never adding any untasteful elements.","Jul 14, 2009"

PopMatters,70,"The disc, produced by the band, is tighter, focused, and much more melodic than in the past. While most of it is fiery, some of the best moments ('Signs of Life') recognize that its often as important to glow as it is to burn.","Jul 14, 2009"
Paste Magazine,70,"One almost gets the impression that the band wanted to test the waters to see if they could still work together without killing each other, and if they couldnt, the only ones affected would be themselves. Turns out, they could, and the result is their most intimate, immediate album to date.","Jul 14, 2009"

AllMusic,91,"Combining Motown falsettos and the best of late-'60s groove rock with spacey loops and hipster-art-collective ?sing-alongs, they deliver a sound that's friendly and familiar without being derivative; it's a sort of retrofitted make-out van on a club crawl.","Jul 14, 2009"
Slant Magazine,80,"The band are able to overcome the production errors through Gourley's elastic vocal counterpoint, bassist Zachary Scott Carothers' pocket-groping lines and licks so gooey they recall a time when Keith Richards could speak in complete sentences. [Aug 2009, p.110]","Jul 14, 2009"
Mojo,80,"Rather than indulging the impulse to ride grooves this mellow off into the sunset, the band keeps one eye trained on the meter (most songs clock in under three minutes), while the other drifts off into the clouds, like on the 60s-era antiwar singalong 'People Say.'","Jul 14, 2009"
PopMatters,80,"The music is, as ever, varied and interesting. The Satanic Satanist is a guitar-centric album and it is all the better for it, as Gourley has a unique knack for riffs and leads.","Jul 14, 2009"

Sputnikmusic,70,"Sugar Ray can sometimes try too hard to seem younger than their years, pushing the dance beats a little bit too hard, and Mark McGrath relies on some unseemly Auto-Tune, but even with this too-evident aural botox, the group remains a guilty pleasure that's a bit hard to resist.","Jul 14, 2009"
Boston Globe,67,"Mark McGrath & Co. are back after six years with Music for Cougars, and still churning out affable pop-rock for various beer-commercial activities (beach volleyball, slo-mo water-balloon fights).","Jul 14, 2009"

AllMusic,50,"These days, of course, the documentary vibe of the band's earlier stuff has transformed into an air of escapism -- not for nothing is one track titled 'When We Were Young.'

Pitchfork,80,"The debut is by no means a hit-packed record, pop is firmly on the backburner here and thrillingly it's precisely this lack of obvious choruses and instead the bizarre little instrumental interludes, spooky stripped down ballads which build and build and attacking grooves that will have you coming back time and time again to it.","Jul  7, 2009"
AllMusic,80,"The propulsive 11-track Horehound finds the White Stripes and Raconteurs frontman every bit as able on the drums as he is on guitar.","Jul  7, 2009"
Entertainment Weekly,75,"The first half of Horehound is just weird enough to be utterly mesmerizing, a series of ominous, fuzzed-out psycho-blues riffs that climax in the tremendous Rush-meets-Jay-Z rave-up of 'Treat Me Like Your Mother.' But creative disintegration floods the record's latter regions with less captivating bump-'n'-grindhouse grooves.","Jul  7, 2009"
Billboard,75,"The songs on Horehound don't so much rock as writhe, reinstituting the idea of the blues as a sinister, morally corrupting force that's as much the province of voodoo priests and witch doctors as musicians.","Jul  7, 2009"
Los Angeles Times,75,"The Dead Weather is a true collaboration, with each band member providing songs (along with input into one anothers songs), and this bunch is talented enough to make even the tracks that are all mood sound just about right.","Jul  7, 2009"

Rolling Stone,75,"Horehound isn't White Stripes tea-party cutesy, and it's not Raconteurs good-times eclectic--it's nothing but riffs and 'tude all the way through.","Jul  7, 2009"
Los Angeles Times,70,"Given the fact that the Dead Weather formed on a whim and recorded these songs in a matter of weeks, Horehound is a compelling album, and one that shows that the band's members bring out the best in each other, albeit in unexpected ways.","Jul  7, 2009"
MSN Consumer Guide (Robert Christgau),70,"The tracks blister with attitude and grit, but the persistent monochrome grows a bit exhausting all coughed out at once. The bitter sandstorm could stand more punctuation, even if it did make Horehound less terrifying.","Jul  7, 2009"

Alternative Press,70,"Its a maiden voyage with a few kinks that need to be worked out. One promising aspect is Whites new pet project, The Kills singer Alison Mosshart.","Jul  7, 2009"
Mojo,70,"Her voice simply doesn't have the heft to project the necessary menace.

AllMusic,45,"The Dead Weather makes smegma rock. Its a squirming, nauseating label no doubt, but so is Horehound, convinced that skuzzed-up guitars and swamp blues roots demand sleaze, humidity, and grime.","Jul  7, 2009"

Tiny Mix Tapes,70,"Sound may have a slight edge over the originally released version of this material, if only because it's truer to the band's initial intentions, and Dandy diehards will certainly find it worth checking out, but more casual fans who already own Monkey House can probably skip it unless they're looking for an intriguing lesson in the nuances of mixing.","Jul  7, 2009"
Urb,70,"'Monkey House' was the band's experiment in '80s synth-rock, and with Elavedo's touch, the razor-sharp, reflective edges of the album's space-age cogs are smoothed and rounded, with the bright-hot electro-pop brought closer to loungey funk.","Jul  7, 2009"
No Ripcord,60,"Unfortunately, despite its improvements, the album still suffers from lackadaisical and unfocused songwriting. Sure, this record is quite a bit better than the one originally released, and kudos to the band for taking the time to prove their point.","Jul  7, 2009"
Slant Magazine,60,"To non-Dandys diehards, these will seem like small differences. Both albums have great, sometimes danceable pop hooks. But for Warholics, the nuances will be celebrated as re-connecting with their original artistic impulses.","Jul  7, 2009"

Billboard,83,"This is Farrars most consistent album in years, in large part because he no longer seems to be straining so much.

Drowned In Sound,80,"American Central Dust doesn't have the feel of a step into new territory the way Son Volt's past two albums did, but it consolidates old strengths and confirms Jay Farrar is still an artist worth caring about to 20 years after Uncle Tupelo cut their first album.","Jun 23, 2009"

The A.V. Club,75,"There's an easiness and directness to these tunes that was missing the last couple of times out, aided by Joe Henry and Ryan Freeland's no-nonsense mix but owing mainly to Farrar's vivid songwriting.","Jun 23, 2009"
Alternative Press,70,"The energetic players temper Farrar's grave persona--for all the vintage touches, this is a deceptively funky band, as the sultry 'Down to the Wire' proves.","Jun 23, 2009"

The Boston Phoenix,37,"Son Volt's label debut, American Central Dust, is some of the sleepiest protest music ever made: Every song saunters by at a slow tempo, Farrar's voice sounds increasingly inexpressive, and John Agnello's production makes everything sound real purdy but lifeless.","Jun 23, 2009"
Spin,37,"The album's sound is raw, but 'raw,' even in the Americana circles that Son Volt travels in, doesn't always equate with primal power. Sometimes it's just undercooked.","Jun 23, 2009"

The New York Times,90,"McCombs still has an ear for language and roll-off-the-tongue singing. His voice coats the lyrics like thick warm caramel on this one.

Los Angeles Times,60,"For the most part, Varshons is pleasantly predictable, with celebrity cameos (Kate Moss, Liv Tyler) and selections from legendary rakes Leonard Cohen and Townes Van Zandt that practically qualify as typecasting.

Pitchfork,70,"Theres also no denying the power of their bittersweet, socially inept aggression, and the ferocity of their sound on Farm.

The A.V. Club,80,"While it's still easy to dismiss his shock tactics as puerile and insensitive (if you're gonna sing about someone 'pretty as a swastika,' they'd better be really ugly), he hasn't sounded this vital--and tuneful--since 'Mechanical Animals.'","May 12, 2009"
cokemachineglow,75,"'High End' makes a deeper impression as a result of Mansons reunion with longtime guitarist-bassist Twiggy Ramirez; together with producers Sean Beavan and Chris Vrenna, they sculpted a sound both harder-hitting and more finely detailed than on any previous Marilyn Manson record.","May 12, 2009"
Los Angeles Times,70,"While most of the album is a fine return to form, there are a few sour spots that are worthy of an eye-roll or two.","May 12, 2009"
Pitchfork,60,"Manson the man at least seems re-energised here....The same cannot always be said for his band; their limp glam metal consistently threatens to undermine the performance. [Jul 2009, p.127]","May 12, 2009"
Slant Magazine,60,"This album marks the return of former bassist Twiggy Ramirez to the band, but as ever the Manson personality/persona towers over everything else, and his two or three musical ideas are repeated throughout the disc, with only a few exceptions.","May 12, 2009"
PopMatters,58,"Musically, the new tunes mostly evoke warmed-over Nine Inch Nails crossed with mediocre '70s metal, and occasionally, the results can be fairly satisfying.","May 12, 2009"
Billboard,50,"The best moments come in the ballads like the blues-tinged 'Four Rusted Horses.' In such songs Manson is almost endearing, just a big melancholy dude with face paint. It's a less glamourous job title than Anticrist Superstar, but these days it suits him better.","May 12, 2009"
Mojo,40,"Perhaps the only interesting thing about Manson's latest record is the couple of anomalies hidden within.","May 12, 2009"
AllMusic,40,"While this isn't a bad album--and Manson diehards are likely to enjoy it quite a bit--there's the sense that it may be an unwanted one.","May 12, 2009"
Rolling Stone,20,"The Marilyn Manson blueprint holds fast, and all the familiar elements are here. The difference is that even Manson sounds unconvinced by his 'antichrist superstar' persona; maybe because his target demographic have grown up and moved on.","May 12, 2009"

Under The Radar,80,"A big part of the energy of Dave Alvin and the Guilty Women comes from the musicians, and while some might think Alvin might be aiming for novelty factor by recording with five women, one listen will wipe those thoughts from your mind.","May  5, 2009"

Rolling Stone,70,"At her best, like on the slow-burn opener 'I Hate the Way,' the lovelorn Xanax and sambuca anthem 'Other Too Endless,' and the rousing single 'Nitrogen Pink,' she successfully bridges the gap between teen pop and adult alternative rock, but when she gets stuck in the confessional too long, the results are more indulgent than powerful.","May  5, 2009"
Dot Music,70,"A bit melodramatic, but undeniably compelling, Scattergoods work has already drawn comparisons to Tori Amos and Kate Bush.","May  5, 2009"
musicOMH.com,60,"While it sometimes does become a bit too overwrought, those people who found Tori Amos' vignettes so compelling will find much to love here. It helps as well that there's a light pop touch on many of the tracks.","May  5, 2009"
The Guardian,60,"Performed alone at the piano, Scattergood's debut would be nearly unbearable, but the widescreen production of soundtrack specialist Simon Fisher Turner goes a long way towards taking the edge off her sixth-form Plathisms and dignifying her emotional melodrama.","May  5, 2009"

Mojo,70,"Occasionally vague, sometimes incohesive and a little self-indulgent it may be, but ultimately Abnormally Attracted to Sin is an abnormally attractive piece of work, and another fine example of the shining talent that is Tori Amos.","Apr 28, 2009"
Q Magazine,70,"But even with its bloated running time, Sin is more thematically satisfying and sonically adventurous than anything Amos has recorded in years.","Apr 28, 2009"
Slant Magazine,67,"The big problem: Abnormally Attracted To Sin is 17 tracks long, and a lot of it could have been left on the cutting-room floor....The remaining 10 or so songs are a reasonably memorable, inspired collection that would have made a pretty great album by themselves.","Apr 28, 2009"
PopMatters,60,"Abnormally Attracted To Sin turns out to be a collection of tracks that simply doesn't work as a whole because it can't properly be listened to in one go. Pity, for somewhere in amongst it all Tori proves that she's still capable of producing a storming album.","Apr 28, 2009"
Pitchfork,60,"Amos doesn't record as much as most artists, and it must be tempting to give fans everything she can, but in this case, it's hurt her a bit. Still there, are many tracks here worth adding to one's Amos shelf.","Apr 28, 2009"

Urb,50,"Unfortunately, these hook-starved arrangements tend toward a static brand of ambient cabaret, which makes Amos' lyrics easy to tune out. Too many little earthquakes, not enough seismic jolts.","Apr 28, 2009"

Drowned In Sound,90,"All of these are very good tunes, but it's the heartfelt content at the album's thematic core that makes 'Em Are I not just Lewis' most consistent album, but also his most truly affecting and easily his most successful outing to date.","Apr 27, 2009"
Slant Magazine,80,"The uptempo tracks are invigorating with their harder guitars and drums, and Lewis' humor abounds, but his slower, softer, acoustic songs are the standouts.","Apr 27, 2009"

Dot Music,50,"When Neilson and co. put the effort into the music (and the lyrics), then Carbeth is a moving portrait of a lost way of life; its a celebration of the world pictured on the album cover, a small cottage hidden in rustic greenery.

Drowned In Sound,100,"Now We Can See is very much a record about vision, death, disease, perspective, and, er, turning into a fish (?) but its great expressive anchor is the elated desperation that gives punk both its wickedness and its promise.","Mar  9, 2009"

PopMatters,75,"Perkins's simple, folk-hymn melodies are helped along by New Orleans brass, harmonica, B-3 organ, and harmonium, their trumpeting and wheezing sounds adding levity to blunt statements.","Feb 17, 2009"

Rolling Stone,90,"Cuomo still doesn't allow himself the freedom to venture in these directions on Weezer's albums, and that's what makes both volumes of Alone quite valuable: they're as eccentric as they are accessible, portraits of a pop hermit letting his mind wander wherever it may take him.","Apr 11, 2006"
Spin,80,"It may be because of its unevenness that Alone II is an intriguing look into Cuomo's complicated mind, because unlike his largely homogenized Weezer albums that have stuck to the center of late, these recordings shed light into every dark corner.","Apr 11, 2006"

Under The Radar,60,"Season of Poison is bound to please fans of goth metal and electro-laced rock, and the gorgeous 'Frozen Oceans' appealingly finishes the album with lush balladry.

Uncut,40,"The band sounds like they're simply trying too hard to keep up with their more contemporaries, and it shows; the song writing is poorly executed, the syrupy hooks are, for the most part, dull and unimaginative, and the band fails to cover any ground it already hasn't before.","Jul 18, 2000"

The A.V. Club,80,"The tracks on Heart On don't veer from EoDM's favored subjects of Los Angeles fakery, sex, girls, sexy girls, and how they're gonna get sexy girls.

Rolling Stone,60,"The duos third LP wont reconcile the two camps; in fact, Heart On may be the first EODM album to really make the detractors case.

Uncut,60,"Obviously nobody's expecting them to record anything revolutionary at this stage of their career, but it's fair to say that this album will probably only get Cure enthusiasts excited.","Jul  4, 2000"
Entertainment Weekly,60,"What Smith sees in goth-metal is a mystery but, sure enough, the final third of 4:13 Dream is studded with the sort of big-haired, suffocating fluff ('The Scream', 'It's Over') that has blighted his band's reputation in recent years. A shame because, at best, when they reconcile themselves to the fact that they are essentially a pop act, albeit one whose dark side is more pronounced than most, the Cure are as thrilling now as they were in the Eighties.","Jul  4, 2000"

Pitchfork,91,"Ryan Adams and his backing band The Cardinals have got their sound down to a science, all right: Cardinology, as embodied by their fourth album in as many years, is a precisely calibrated method of creating cool, reflective pools of vocal harmonies and pedal steel, accented from time to time by fiery electric-guitar licks.","Jun 27, 2000"
Austin Chronicle,80,"These are modest pleasures but these days Ryan Adams is all about careful measured craft instead of big statements, a trade-off that makes his albums more predictable but also more satisfying as Cardinology quietly proves.","Jun 27, 2000"

AllMusic,70,"Like 'Tiger,' Cardinology is long on midtempo country-rock shuffles that sound comfortable with their own familiarity; Adams isn't straining to reinvent the Great Art of American Songwriting, and that allows you to focus on what he and the cardinals are actually playing, as opposed to what they're thinking about playing.","Jun 27, 2000"

Uncut,60,"The other two tunes here, the instrumental 'Ponce of the Flaming Peace Queer' and a once-again-relevant cover of 'Fortunate Son,' work fine, but, coupled with the albums brief tracklist and tossed-off nature, they make Peace Queer little more than a focused stop-gap between proper albums.","Jun  6, 2000"
No Ripcord,60,"For his last couple of albums, cowpunk songster Snider has pitched himself in the sort of satiracally confrontational and liberal-minded territory occuupied by Randy Newman or Steve Earle. Peace Queer follows that pattern. [Jan 2008, p.113]","Jun  6, 2000"
Q Magazine,60,"For his eigth studio album he's gone over the top politically. [Feb 2009, p.116]","Jun  6, 2000"

Under The Radar,75,"Reefer works best as a moment thats fleeting.","May 27, 2000"
The A.V. Club,70,"Despite it all, Reefer is Thorburn's best album of the year, and it is so successful because it feels tossed off, like he's not trying so hard.","May 27, 2000"
Alternative Press,69,"Reefer feels like a pleasant departure from that tired self-parody; tossed-off but in a good way.","May 27, 2000"
Dot Music,60,"As a whole, Reefer has proven its capacity for producing sunshine hits, but only time will tell if it will be able to push itself past the spaced-out beaches of Maui and towards more diverse soundscapes.","May 27, 2000"

AllMusic,80,"These lads really knock together a proper tune. [Oct 2008, p.108]","May 23, 2000"
Spin,80,"This is a hugely infectious debut. [Oct 2008, p.81]","May 23, 2000"
AllMusic,60,"It's not going to challenge anyone, but it would bring a welcome touch of class to the charts. [Oct 2008, p.139]","May 23, 2000"
Blender,40,"They rarely take a step out of their neat little country twinged pop-rock corner. This is a real shame because these songs belie a musicianship that can produce work much greater than this.","May 23, 2000"

Austin Chronicle,90,"What's striking about Dig Out Your Soul is how its relentless onslaught of sound proves as enduring as the tunes.","May 23, 2000"
PopMatters,80,"It won't win them any new fans, but those that believed the truth last time will dig this.","May 23, 2000"
Tiny Mix Tapes,80,"More than anything else, theres a feeling that Dig Out Your Soul might actually be their best album in over a decade. In other words, not quite the fabled, oft-promised Best one since fookin 'Definitely Maybe!'' but certainly the best one since fookin '...Morning Glory.'","May 23, 2000"
Uncut,80,"Those follow-up albums were disappointments because, aside from a catchy song or two, they were tedious. Dig Out Your Soul defies this trend and is their most compelling offering in years.","May 23, 2000"
Q Magazine,80,"Noel Gallagher comes up with a half-dozen tracks as good as the classic-rock epic 'The Turning,' or 'The Shock of the Lightning,' which swaggers as confidently as Oasis did a dozen years ago.","May 23, 2000"
Prefix Magazine,80,"With this balanced collection of solid rockers, more airy, toned-down tracks and far less self-indulgent noodling, Oasis prove they can learn from their mistakes.","May 23, 2000"
Pitchfork,70,"Noel Gallagher wrote two more tunes here, both excellent. Unfortunately, age has softened his heart, and he cedes the album's other half to his bandmates (including lead-singing brother Liam), who offer subpar material.","May 23, 2000"
cokemachineglow,70,"Dig Out Your Soul, however, is the sound of a band rediscovering its snarl.","May 23, 2000"
Tiny Mix Tapes,70,"To that end, and overabundant allusions to The Beatles aside, Dig Out Your Soul is a feat in its own right.","May 23, 2000"
Mojo,70,"Noel provides the best songs on Dig Out Your Soul, although his bandmates certainly cant be accused of slacking in their efforts. The problem with this one is that its front-loaded with Noels songs, which makes the proceedings start to drag a bit.","May 23, 2000"
Uncut,67,"Qualitywise, most of the tracks here are more ''Bungalow Bill'' than ''Eleanor Rigby.''","May 23, 2000"
Q Magazine,67,"Dig Out Your Soul continues Oasis' relatively impressive late-period resurgence.","May 23, 2000"
musicOMH.com,63,"There's a forward motion to the backward glances, but the spiritual-philosophical bent of many of the songs suggests that brothers Noel and Liam Gallagher preferred the era when rock stars set out to explore the meaning of life rather than maximize the monetization of their brand.","May 23, 2000"
AllMusic,60,"Oasis can still occasionally produce songs suggestive of the breezy insouciance that marked their early years--the new single 'The Shock of the Lightning' among them--but more often on Dig Out Your Soul, they sound as though they're killing themselves trying to come up with something that'll do.","May 23, 2000"
Observer Music Monthly,60,"It's an uninspiring ending to a record that it's best faces up to some pretty downbeat truths and thus seems to fit right into the current national mood.","May 23, 2000"
New Musical Express (NME),60,"If there are moments when the feted snap and snarl of yore amounts to little more than ramming generic blues licks down the audience's throat, they're tempered with moments of discovery like the lysergic 'To Be Where There's Life' and 'Falling Down' which displays an uncharacteristic lightness of touch.","May 23, 2000"
Slant Magazine,60,"It sounds so good; really, it sounds better than it is.","May 23, 2000"
Hartford Courant,60,"For those who have happily stuck around this long already Dig Out certainly wont be the straw that breaks the camels back--by all means, it lightens the load quite considerably. But it does so with the dawning realisation that, 17 years and seven albums in, this is a high point in a career deficient in high points.","May 23, 2000"
NOW Magazine,60,"Overall, Dig Out Your Soul is a dark, heavy, chart-snubbing record that acts Oasiss age (main songwriter Noel Gallagher is 42) and is their first in eons that doesnt seem desperate to please. Oasis have their devil back.","May 23, 2000"
Spin,60,"On a cursory listen to Dig Out Your Soul, it's hard not to think 'yeah, it's Oasis' and then unwittingly switch off - not through boredom or distraction, but because it's all so comfortable and, well, familiar.","May 23, 2000"
Billboard,60,"Dig Out Your Soul might not be the sound of envelopes being pushed, but its mix of kitchen-sink production and too many vague songs mark a deviation from business as usual that ultimately fails to deliver. [Nov 2008, p.105]","May 23, 2000"
musicOMH.com,60,"A second Oasis album to better 'Standing On the Shoulders Of Giants' and 'Heathen Chemistry,' but one too, that promises so much only to fall so short. [Nov 208, p.104]","May 23, 2000"
Trouser Press,50,"This album shows that they know what they're good at and that their latter-day acoustic balladry and epic wanking were getting tired. [Fall 2008, p.77]","May 23, 2000"
Entertainment Weekly,50,"Dig Out Your Soul is an almost comically generic Oasis release, from its preponderance of plodding midtempo rockers ('Bag It Up,' 'Waiting for the Rapture') to the vaguely Indian raga-flavored psychedelic anthems ('To Be Where There's Life').","May 23, 2000"
The A.V. Club,49,"for now we're stuck with Dig Out Your Soul, which like every Oasis album from 1997's 'Be Here Now' onward, makes cursory gestures toward making the band's mod-rock more modernist, before reverting back to the same ol', same ol'.","May 23, 2000"
Los Angeles Times,40,"Dig Out Your Soul isnt the worst record Oasis have produced, but even the heavily shat-upon (an unfairly so, in this writers opinion) Heathen Chemistry was comfortable within its own skin.","May 23, 2000"
The Guardian,37,"An overall sound thats been compressed and flatlined into one continuous buzz, this sounds like a tired band that had already gone through the motions before it even started.","May 23, 2000"

Uncut,91,"Chief Lambchopper Kurt Wagner's magpie tendencies are fully displayed on the band's lovely 10th proper album.","May 16, 2000"
Dot Music,90,"OH (ohio) is flat-out one of the best records Lambchop has made, and certainly their best since 2000s classic 'Nixon.'","May 16, 2000"
The New York Times,83,"With OH (ohio), Wagner has crafted a soundtrack of specific detail for that lazy mid-morning melancholy that comes to anyone who feels like the world is turning without them. Enjoy it.","May 16, 2000"
PopMatters,83,"Whatever: just?listen to the damn disc.","May 16, 2000"
Blender,80,"Taken as a whole, however, OH consists of more stellar stuff from a band thats always taken the tortoises view of the race.","May 16, 2000"
Drowned In Sound,80,"While the upbeat Lambchop records of the past are missed, OH (ohio) is a well-paced and engaging trip through Wagner's lush, scenic tunes.","May 16, 2000"
Mojo,80,"Their tenth LP OH (ohio) lands with some nervous expectation attached. As it turns out, its their best record since 2000 landmark, 'Nixon.'","May 16, 2000"
Q Magazine,80,"As ever, Wagner's narratives, such as on 'National Talk Like A Pirate Day,' are impressionistic, shifting time and perspectives, like the Norman Raeburn-influenced Dylan of 'Blood On The Tracks.'","May 16, 2000"
Under The Radar,80,"His dry, enunciative singing style still achieve a remarkable combination of pretension and playfulness. Lambchop may be evolving, but its capacity for sounding like nothing else remains intact.","May 16, 2000"
Rolling Stone,80,"OH (Ohio) is a singular accomplishment, and it's hard to imagine anyone but Lambchop doing this so well--or even imagining it at all.","May 16, 2000"
Pitchfork,80,"'Of Raymond' one exquisite lick of brass sends out enough light to illuminate the whole record. [Nov 2008, p.106]","May 16, 2000"
Sputnikmusic,80,"The emotional tenor on Lambchops 10th LP is hard to miss. Not that theres anything wrong with being touchy and tender, but the calm, spare arrangements on OH (ohio) can only be described as pretty.","May 16, 2000"
Paste Magazine,79,"Consider OH the 'most Lambchop' of Lambchop releases, as it swings through almost every tone in the band's history of influence-collisions, arriving at a soul of its own.","May 16, 2000"
Entertainment Weekly,70,"The album's pace quickens on tracks such as 'Sharing A Gibson With Martin Luther King, Jr.' and 'Popeye,' only to drift back into the lilt that makes OH (Ohio) one of Lambchop's finest. [Fall 2008, p.76]","May 16, 2000"
PopMatters,70,"OH (Ohio) ends with a straight-faced rendition of the hokey country standard 'I Believe in You,' with lyrical mush about dogs and babies, but Wagner sings it like he wants to believe every word.","May 16, 2000"
Lost At Sea,70,"That is part of Lambchops charm--irony might be the hipster flavor for the time being, but youd be hard-pressed to find less ironic and more modestly beautiful sentiment than on OH (Ohio).","May 16, 2000"
Paste Magazine,70,"Its restrained combination of new and old, tradition and innovation, sums up the strengths of OH (ohio), an album which isn't another Lambchop masterpiece, but rather a fine addition to an extraordinary body of work.","May 16, 2000"
Dusted Magazine,70,"Give Oh Ohio time--there's more than enough here to breath life back into a resurgent band.","May 16, 2000"
Billboard,70,"Oh (Ohio)'s languid chamber folk murmurs as expected with Wagner sketching vivid relationship dramas like a master painter. Should it all sound overly proper, a closer listen revals sly humor in the details. [Nov 2008, p.96]","May 16, 2000"
Uncut,67,"OH (ohio) gets the sophistication and tone right, but something's slightly off.","May 16, 2000"
Dot Music,60,"OH (Ohio), typically for the Lambchop, is at its best when it's specialising in tight-wound reserve.","May 16, 2000"
Boston Globe,40,"After nine albums the Nashville oddball's parade of styles has dissolved into ambient noodling.","May 16, 2000"
AllMusic,40,"The Nashville bands ninth studio album is definitely sleepy and nuanced, only Wagners halted singing is disintegrating further into the background as the overall sound inches closer to adult contemporary.","May 16, 2000"
Mojo,40,"Aside from the relatively oomph-laden, piano-driven 'Sharing A Gibson Withh Martin Luther King Jr.' and a lonesome cover of Don Williams's 'I Believe In You,' there's barely a melody to savour. [Nov 2008, p.118]","May 16, 2000"
