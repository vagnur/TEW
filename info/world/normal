And because of that, they should be considered as interesting. But they are not. I never heard lyrics that dumb (if you translate from english to french, it goes 'Africa, it's not only war, Africa, it's not only hunger, it's also sun, happiness', which is the best way to convey the toughest clichs about Africa). The music is OK, but really, it is so dull when compared to that of Rokia Traor, who really mixes traditional and modern music in an unheard-before way. No, really, I can't help thinking Amadou & Mariam is world music for people who actually use the expression 'world music' : uneducated people who like to think themselves as curious and open minded.",0,1,"Dec 29, 2008"

It's easy to accuse these guys of recreating music that was invented years ago, but why should that dilute the enthusiasm, joy and fine musicianship they have? It's just upsetting that fellow folk that share this appreciation have been labelled 'uneducated' by people that clearly have a chip on their shoulder about music that reaches the masses. The term 'world music' references anything that falls outside the common genres of mainly (though not always) American and British music. It helps record shops and review magazines organise their music, simple as that. Even though I've been guilty of it myself, It's not 'cool' to dislike the mainstream and just quote obscure artists.

The songs in  Portuguese  are the most beautiful, but even then I feel like I'm riding a snowboard carried by the same beats and sounds that are in every other song in this album. I guess what I'm trying to say is that nothing really works in this album. The sound tries to mess samba, hip-hop, and pop, but their are way too many loose ends to actually work.

Granted, most of us probably never would have heard these songs without something like this coming across the waters, but that's the fault of the vacuous suits calling themselves music programmers on our culture's airwaves. It's like taking the best of the English Invasion, putting it on K-tel, and then calling it the Album of the Year. It's simply absurd. If the album on which these songs sprung sucked Amazon water to begin with, chances are one song wasn't worth the time of day when it was originally released either.

To my ears, it sounds like a cross between Joao Gilberto and a Nuggets boxset. If that sounds at all intriguing to you, check it out. You'll be glad you did.",0,0,"Apr 13, 2006"

10,"A near perfect primer on the great sounds of the Tropicalia movement of the late '60s. This is great stuff. Beautiully presented and with excellent liner notes. It will have you wanting more. Please note: One is entitled to one's opinion, but in this case, I highly doubt that the two zero star reviews on here even listened to this disc. I don't understand the mentality behind a zero rating just to negate a discs position. Ignornant.",0,0,"May 18, 2006"

Every track stands on its own, but together as a whole this is more interesting than most of the complitionas of any genre out there period!...and i work for a music retailer myself. Highly suggested to any fan of bossa nova/tropicalia, or funky beat in general. As for Dave A, he is just bitter cuz Brittney is Fat and pregnant and wont be comming out with a new album anytime soon.",0,0,"Jun 28, 2006"
6,"I guess if I was rating this from the perspective of Tropicalia music, I'd give it a higher rating, but on the scale of new music for 2006, I give it a 6.

6,"Just be aware, to the uninitiated or the bossa nova fan, about half of the songs on this CD come off as 60s showtunes. Think, the soundtrack to 'Hair'. The booklet is admittedly fantastic and does help give the music context as part of a larger political movement. But given the dissonant indian experiments and Oklahoma-tinged showtunes, dilettantes and more casual Brazilian music fans like might enjoy this more an interesting historical document than a either a relaxing or a rocking beginning to end listen.",0,0,"Sep  6, 2006"

9,"An exceptional release from an exceptional band. Their repertoire of adhoc electronic instruments exudes an unpolished charm that transcends the basic 'world music' label. Some may compare them to Can, or to Aphex Twin and his ilk, but Konono N1 is on another level. A guaranteed hit both with those contemplative musicologist types and those looking to trance their tits off.",0,0,"Nov 18, 2007"
6,"I have to agree with David M, although I would also put Sleater-kinney in that severely overrated category as well. A decent enough listen but I think that it is getting alot of kudos just because the guy is somewhat of a legend in the world music scene. It was the same with 'Smile.' It was a good album, but not 97 on metacritic good, and even critics that initially gave it a really high score realized that in retrospect, as was evident by the fact that it only appeared on no more than half of the end of year lists and was number one on only a few.",0,0,"Dec  9, 2005"

This album has been way overrated on account of it's well meaning political intentions, but as music...I am really unimpressed, and I've given it a solid 8 or 9 listens now. Only closing track is fantastic, and only one or two others (ie. Muy Fifi) memorable. Worst, all of the weakest tracks are Cooders own compositions.

I was impressed with the collection of talent used for the production of this album, but hugely dissappointed when I bought it and took a listen, it's an overrated album and downright obnoxious sometimes.

10,"You got to acknowledge that Mr. Cooder came home to his roots of Los Angeles. Not just for himself, but for all of us growing up here in Los Angeles and in the latino community. The mixture of of styles in the music is what the average latino listened to. I was not born at the time of these political crimes till 1961, I did grow up here in Los Angeles in the middle of a city with different nationalities listening to all different styles of music. Me especially because I was into music because on my mother and father. But I went further listening to Blues,Rock,Jazz,Swing,Classical,the different Latinos styles,acoustic and electric. Latinos in Los Angeles listened to all styles of music. So the mixture on the recordings for that time period is appropriate for the subject matter.
