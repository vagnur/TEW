PopMatters,80,"Seven years was certainly worth the wait for Day by Day, one of the 2008s best releases. The album features all the hallmarks of a pop sensationtight arrangements with intoxicating hooks, rousing choruses, and sing-along vocals.","Nov 18, 2008"
Entertainment Weekly,75,"Femi's always good for a few easy-riding horn grooves and political calls to arms that his old man would be proud of, which is more than most musicians not named Kuti can claim.","Nov 18, 2008"
Austin Chronicle,67,"The album lacks the gut-punch intensity of brother Seun Kuti's recent debut, and the lyrics occasionally border on the trite, but Femi certainly lives up to the family name.","Nov 18, 2008"
Observer Music Monthly,60,"Femi's new album suffers in comparison to Seun's  while the tracks are fairly enjoyable, Femi's lyrics are the usual worthy but clunking stuff.","Nov 18, 2008"

The Boston Phoenix,100,"Blending in traditional strings and flutes, singular soulful vocals, trenchant dub pockets, and inventive production flourishes, this is the most powerful contemporary release out of Ethiopia in years.","Oct  7, 2008"
Billboard,80,"It's an intriguing, somewhat surprising collection of tunes. Oftentimes dub projects can be anchored in a recurrent groove, but Page has created a group of tracks that are quite distinctive.","Oct  7, 2008"
The Guardian,80,"From the gently stomping reggae of Ophir Dub to the widescreen soundscape of Yeka Sub City Rockers, it's an exhilarating fusion.","Oct  7, 2008"
AllMusic,80,"Strongly recommended to all adventurous dub fans.","Oct  7, 2008"
Pitchfork,76,"British producer and Transglobal Underground vet Nick Page, aka Dub Colossus, got the ball bouncing with A Town Called Addis, an intriguing conflation of reggae and dub sensibilities with Ethiopian pop. It's an ingenious idea made more interesting by its roundabout mode of composition.","Oct  7, 2008"

The Boston Phoenix,100,"The music is neither bastardized nor precious, just a riveting reflection of the ongoing allure and paradox that is the Congo.","Jul 15, 2008"
The A.V. Club,91,"The result is even more appealing than Konono, drawing on likembes, the buzzing and drum-like tam tam, electric guitars, and half a dozen vocalists to create hypnotic, rich, complex polyrhythmic wonders.","Jul 15, 2008"
AllMusic,90,"The sound is terrific, the presentation is handsome, the sound and selection are amazing; and negotiations with musicians are not done on colonial terms.","Jul 15, 2008"
MSN Consumer Guide (Robert Christgau),83,"It serves up the distorted buzz Congotronics fans jones for, sonics that are generally raunchy even though the thumb pianos also generate balafon beauty, and five lead singers.","Jul 15, 2008"
Blender,80,"In a style gentler and more richly textured than the crudely amplified minimalism of the series debut by Konono N1, the songs swell in and out of expansive and hypnotic patterns, forming clouds of interwoven rhythms.","Jul 15, 2008"
Dusted Magazine,80,"Less encumbered by the colonial detritus of Konono's overdriven drums-meet-junkyard sound, the Allstars let the rhythm section breathe and get funky with indigenous instrumentation. No distortion necessary.","Jul 15, 2008"
The Guardian,80,"Making use of relentless, repeated riffs, matched again chanting drum patterns and occasional guitar solos, their often lengthy songs are exhilarating, edgy and at times downright spooky.","Jul 15, 2008"
Village Voice,80,"The clever (and accurate) branding that associated the warm, metallic grids of those thumb pianos (or likembes) with repetitive electronic music. On that front, 7th Moon doesn't disappoint a bit.","Jul 15, 2008"

Pitchfork,78,"This album is a vital addition to the Congotronics series, and anyone who's enjoyed the series so far needs to hear it.","Jul 15, 2008"
Rolling Stone,70,"Mostly they provide gentle melodic loops familiar to fans of old-school soukous and indie-rock fusionists like Vampire Weekend. But sometimes they break ranks.","Jul 15, 2008"

PopMatters,60,"In their multi-ethnic make-up, the face-painted, twenty-something strong Allstars chant a slightly more devolved game than fellow marimba manglers Konono No.1, but the cumulative effect is similar, a sustained concussion of sound, a kind of sonic vertigo that subverts the clich of Congo as perpetual victim.","Jul 15, 2008"

Drowned In Sound,80,"Hera Ma Nono still possesses an often awkward transition between the jarring Kenyan and North American influences, but this also essentially provides Extra Golden with their character.","Oct  9, 2007"
Dusted Magazine,80,"As with their earlier release, Extra Golden seems to shine particularly in two speeds: an amped up tango rhythm that seems to accompany the more soul-driven songs, and a faster gallop that tends to yield the most sweat","Oct  9, 2007"
Stylus Magazine,75,"Hera Ma Nono improves on 'Ok-Oyot System' in almost every way: the guitar sounds are more vibrant (padded with reverbs, phasers, and other bubbly what-have-yous); the songs hang together better as a record; the slide between Swahili, English, and Luo is as effortless and colorful as good pidgin; and, most importantly, it usually gets at--or at least hints at--African musics most cherished balance: unhurriedness with a pulse.","Oct  9, 2007"
Pitchfork,74,"Unlike 'Ok-Oyot System,' Hera Ma Nono credits all songs to the band, as opposed to individual band members, and no doubt the results sound more cohesive as well.","Oct  9, 2007"
Blender,70,"The 2005 AIDS-related death of Extra Golden cofounder Otieno Jagwasi shades the follow-up to last years rough yet lovable 'Ok-Oyot System.'","Oct  9, 2007"
cokemachineglow,70,"Moments on Hera Ma Nono sound a little AOR for a label as experimental as Thrill Jockey, and one suspects that a tasteful re-branding is all that's keeping Extra Golden and their fascinating dance music from the heights of legitimacy currently enjoyed by much less challenging, much less 'World' bands.","Oct  9, 2007"
PopMatters,70,"The songs themselves are trimmer and sweeter than they were on the first album, and the outro is inspired.","Oct  9, 2007"

Lost At Sea,65,"Overall, Hera Ma Nono left a good impression with several notable points, however, there will be no drooling this time around.","Oct  9, 2007"

Los Angeles Times,100,"Now, like an intermittent short-wave transmission that suddenly catches a clear and vivid frequency, Radiolina comes into sharp focus, defining a mature sound in a mesmerizing collection of 21 new tracks.","Sep  4, 2007"
Observer Music Monthly,100,"An album packed with tuneful songs that would sound great coming out of radio speakers.","Sep  4, 2007"
Uncut,100,"La Radiolina reaches out beyond it's core audience to a universal constituency, not so much a world music record as a global-rock mission statement.","Sep  4, 2007"
Filter,92,"La Radiolina emerges as a delicious bouillabaisse of gypsy punk, reggae and countless indigenous sounds, expertly stirred by a band of brawling pirates who plunder each port for musical spices and then add them to the cauldron.","Sep  4, 2007"
Entertainment Weekly,91,"And though he sings mostly in French or Spanish, Chao's music is so sonically vivid, so gloriously evocative, translation seems almost superfluous.","Sep  4, 2007"
The A.V. Club,91,"He's a one-man musical melting pot who synthesizes several continents' worth of ideas, sounds, and slogans into one swinging all-night dance party. This is internationalism at its funkiest.","Sep  4, 2007"
MSN Consumer Guide (Robert Christgau),91,"This is a speedier pop suite suitable for dancing or straightening up the flat.","Sep  4, 2007"

Hartford Courant,80,"The jumble of languages and sounds gives La Radiolina the feel of a noisy, colorful street bazaar where there's chaotic beauty on the surface and a certain poetic logic that runs underneath.","Sep  4, 2007"

Paste Magazine,80,"One of the most poignant protest albums released since the U.S. invaded Iraq.","Sep  4, 2007"
Blender,80,"Chaos jovial, chatty, Spanish-English-French crooning helps the ADD sensibility flow into something that feels like a happy incantation rather than a protesters harangue against George Bush.","Sep  4, 2007"
NOW Magazine,80,"On La Radiolina, an unmistakable molotov cocktail of fierce resistance anthems, Manu Chao continues to do what he does best.","Sep  4, 2007"
Pitchfork,75,"The album is not as wholly satisfying as either 'Clandestino' or 'Esperanza,' mostly due to a handful of truncated, underdeveloped tracks toward the end, but it's still full of excellent songs and inspired collisions.","Sep  4, 2007"
Hot Press,75,"Chao is at best when merging his Latin/salsa influences with squealing, screeching garage-rock.","Sep  4, 2007"
Rolling Stone,70,"Eventually La Radiolina's more guitar-based sonics will feel inevitable too, especially once you follow the same dynamic riff through three consecutive songs up front.","Sep  4, 2007"

Stylus Magazine,67,"A bit jumbled together and disorienting, but overall just about as rejuvenating as anything.","Sep  4, 2007"
cokemachineglow,63,"It's a safe album, almost exactly what you'd expect from Chao. The artist continues to be the best (perhaps only) provider out there of Clash-inspired polylingual punk rock, but for a musician who built his solo reputation on quirkiness and innovation, the disc feels a bit flat.","Sep  4, 2007"
The Guardian,60,"There are some great songs here, including the infuriatingly catchy 'Politik Kills' along with the swirling catalogue of global problems, 'Rainin in Paradize,' and the charmingly upbeat 'Besoin de la Lune.' Then there's the Spanish-influenced 'Me Llaman Calle,' and a furious wailing French rocker about motorway panic--followed by a batch of songs that mostly sound like Manu Chao on cruise control.","Sep  4, 2007"
The New York Times,60,"The disappointment of La Radiolina is that Manu Chaos music isnt as arrestingly odd as it used to be. Too often his bands ska-punk gets uncomfortably close to dull rock, and the repetition doesnt communicate we are all singing the same song","Sep  4, 2007"

The Boston Phoenix,50,"La Radiolina is the most rockist album of his solo career--and also the most disappointing.","Sep  4, 2007"
Austin Chronicle,40,"Desgraciadamente, that's when Radiolina smashes against the wall. Fragments--stadium chants--rather than songs compound a larger issue of 'Rainin in Paradize' drenching the rest of the album.","Sep  4, 2007"
