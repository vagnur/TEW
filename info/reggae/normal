2,"This is a failure for a die hard fan like me. The album has lost the  authentic grooves, its more on the country music concept than raggae music. So disappointing that they themselves didnt realise that UB40 is pure raggae band not 'Country Mixed Raggae' band. I know its a tribute to country music but the hypnotic raggae sound is gone.

0,"Much like will.i.am's atrocious solo LP '#willpower', Snoop Dog has failed to pretend. He's failed to pretend to be someone else. You know, I thought It was that artists should be original, and experimental on building their own sound, but most mainstream pop and hip hop is trying to knock off as many other popular new artists as possible. No snoop, you're not Bob Marley, and you're not the next coming of him, either. You're too high.",3,4,"Apr 28, 2013"

8,"Well, this album was a surprise. First, there was the name change, then a confirmed duet with Miley Cyrus and then the announcement that the album was going to be reggae. Eh? Well, this bewildering collection of information resulted in one of the most surprising albums I've reviewed this year. Snoop has done a complete 180 and is suddenly all about peace and love in this album that's bursting with pure Caribbean sunshine. Starting off with the epic Rebel Way, already my expectations were high and were fufilled as track after track went by. There's traditional reggae tracks like Here Comes The King, So Long, Fruit Juice, La La La and Harder Times, more modern ones like The Good Good and a throwback to his old style (but much more peaceful) in the form of Lighters Up. I especially appreciate his heartfelt call for peace in No Guns Allowed. The only downsides were the Rita Ora and Miley Cyrus collaborations. Other than that, this was thoroughly enjoyable and put a big smile on my face. Definitely get the deluxe version as all the tracks there are good. Now, a lot of fans have come down hard on Snoop for this album, calling him fake and saying he's betrayed his fans by changing his style. Well, I agree that those collabs with popstars was a bad idea, but his conversion to a new way of life and making an album to coincide with that seems genuine. And I believe an artist should challenge themselves and their fans too. This album was risky and I keep seeing negative reviews everywhere and I think it's so unwarranted. Very few rappers make albums about happiness and harmony. It's refreshing to hear a mainstream rapper, especially Snoop, of all people, sing songs that have absolutely nothing to do with bragging about how much money and hos they have. If he keeps making albums like this, I might consider myself a fan and I know I'll be playing Reincarnated all summer. Make the music you feel like making in your heart, Snoop, and let the haters hate.",1,2,"May  1, 2013"
2,"Just horrible. It's an improvement over his final rap album, Doggumentary, but that being said, it's not that much better. Many of the tracks, such as 'Get Away', 'Fruit Juice', and 'The Good Good', are abominations to humanity. There are, however, some good songs, such as 'Rebel Way', 'No Guns Allowed', 'Remedy', and 'Harder Times', but other than those few songs, the rest is just trash.",1,3,"Apr 23, 2013"

9,"Strictly speaking this album is not only a reincarnation but also an evolution and revelation on Snoop Lion's infinite talent. La La La...Snoop Lion laid this track down as if he was born to the roots of reggae.  True roots reggae fans and true Snoop fans will love this album becasue it shows a more enlighend side to a truly talented artist.  I was mostly impressed by the conscious lyrics of the songs portrayed such as 'no guns allowed'   When I heard this album I  ran out and  bought 10 copies to send to my friends that i know would appreciate this  side of Snoop and It met all their expectations on more.  I grew up listening to snoop and while this album is vastly different than anything he has ever done it does show that artists like snoop are  not afraid of wanting more, showing more, willing to evolve and embrace various aspects of their talents. True, this album will take the regular fans by surprise but if given a chance to open up the minds it will take you to new places in the recesses of the mind and the aim of the artist.   Big up!  Reincarnated.  The lion has returned and the light is truly shining!",0,1,"Jun 29, 2013"

The songs are just like you expect them to be, they are chill, encouraging, and touch on controversial aspects of this era. But sometimes they can be too chill and just playing weird.

7,"Natalie and Eric came out of nowhere with an album that sounds like it's been shaped over the course of a decade. The usual derision that would come with a white, brother and sister indie band playing reggae is not here, because let's face it  there aren't that many white, brother and sister, indie reggae playing bands. They are a breath of fresh air. The sounds are authentic and flow with ease. They are also catchier than syphilis. And it's not all reggae here and not all female vocals either. Eric steps in for the track 'When It's Over', detailing the demise of a relationship.
The lyrical content is piercing, but not intense. Instrumentation is accentuated beautifully with horns and genuine reggae and ska basslines. This is a very fresh, incredibly likeable debut and one that fills a gap, modernizes a genre and remains as true to their inspiration as you could hope a band to get. I genuinely hope to hear more from WB.",2,2,"Sep  1, 2013"

9,"While arguably the most pop-friendly album Matisyahu has made, this album is still fantastic.  From the first track, Crossroads, you can feel that something has changed.  There is a fire to Matisyahu's verses paralleling his change in the way he looked at religion around this time.  Songs like Buffalo Soldier (ft Shyne) are an interesting merge of different styles that pays off extremely well.  The Middle Eastern samples mixed with pop and rap beats is a strange yet well-executed combination.  This is the album that may please the wider public while upsetting some fans of his older material.  Regardless of such reactions, this album's brilliant production and lyrics cannot be ignored.",0,0,"Jul 27, 2015"

7,"A lyrically robust collection with unfortunately average production.Nas and Damian Marley are two of the most intellectual songwriters in the industry. Their lyrics displayed portraits of frustration, poverty, angst, politics, crime, and hope. It is only right that they make an album together making a unique experience of reggae and hip hop.The lyrics are amazingly complex but are able to bring points across. The lyrical mafioso Nasir Jones, as always laces his words with staggering flows, multisyllabic rhythms, creativity, and sense. He shows his analysis of modern day life through detailed observations that have underlying tones of criticism.The guest vocals don't do bad either. K'Naan gives a thoughtful verse on Tribal War and Stevie Wonder is a beautiful fit. But Lil Wayne? Weezy does not quite belong on an album like this. He should have been featured on a quieter track. He sounds out of tune on My Generation. Even lead star Damian gets tiresome in songs like Nah Mean.The biggest fault of the album however is the production. Parts are brilliant but others are repetitive and ultimately boring. The sound is dated and unoriginal. The blandness simply cannot fit with the mighty prose.Distant Relatives is somewhat of an extra to one's collection. The rhymes are the main show but the production really keeps it from being a classic. Maybe a little more ambition could have helped.",0,0,"Aug 13, 2010"

One Day will live on as one of Matisyahu's biggest hits for a reason, it is extremely powerful.

When I bought Yell Fire, I was blown away by the first two songs but, after that, I thought it was very average.
