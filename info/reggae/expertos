Mojo,70,"More often than not, Mr. Marley lives up to the ambition that his last name demands of him. With any luck, his next album will have fewer guests and more of the introspection and steadfastness he reveals in Its Alright, a hymnlike ballad that he sings on his own.","Sep 30, 2016"

AllMusic,70,"Ziggy Marley, the LP, shares much in common with Robert Palmer's Pride, Black Uhuru's Chill Out, and even Gregory Isaacs' Night Nurse, as its diminutive, deft, funky, tight, electro-tinged, and sincere.

The Observer (UK),70,"Evaluating it across his whole catalog, this occupies the second-tier below uncopyable classics that he churned out in the beginning of the 2000s.

The Observer (UK),80,"Sutherland is a massively charismatic character, and its hard not to get caught up in the elation that he so obviously feels when he gets from finding the perfect groove.
