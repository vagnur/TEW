10,"Amazing album. Blending a mix of nu folk and nordic pop, Florence delievers an amazing album.

Florence also dares to use multiple styles to further demonstrate the scale and creativity of her voice. Very impressive album.",3,3,"Mar 20, 2012"

It's booming drums and plucking harps and jangling tambourines paired with Florence's pitch-perfect, dominant voice work together in perfect harmony. This album is a work of pure genius that catapults Florence up there with the likes of Lady GaGa. Perfection.",2,2,"Jan  2, 2011"
9,"This album is truly an amazing and impressive debut. I bought 'Ceremonials', their sophomore album, before this one and I thought 'Ceremonials' was great. But when I bought 'Lungs', it easily became one of my favorite albums of all time. 'Lungs' shows of some incredible indie pop, baroque production, but the best thing are definitely Florence Welch's strong, powerful pipes. Her voice is absolutely stunning. She expresses a maybe soprano vocal range that can make you feel sad and uplifted at the same time. But, there are some weird and maybe unnecessary tracks in this album. The dark and spooky My Boy Build Coffins kinda sucks. Between Two Lungs is one of the weaker tracks by Florence + The Machine. The boring I'm Not Calling You A Liar is unnecessary. But that's the only bad stuff. The good tracks are the reggae-influenced Hurricane Drunk, the fast almost danceable Drumming Song, the vocal masterpiece of Dog Days Are Over, the lyrically powerful track Cosmic Love, and the punk infused Kiss With A Fist. This album is one of my favorite albums that I own. If you are into or want to listen to an indie pop, vocally powerful album, get this one.",2,2,"Jun 29, 2012"
9,"Florence knows how to be powerful and not get too Aretha, exagerating a beat. With strange lyrics, a lot of harps and cytaras, and a sweet and at the same time tough vocal, she gives us the indiest album I have ever listen. And her live performances are the best thing, with great presence and terrific voice. 'Dog Days Are Over', 'Between Two Lungs', 'Bird Song' and 'Cosmic Love' are one of this greatest on this great CD.",2,2,"Oct  2, 2011"

8,"Pretty decent album. Her calling card Kiss With A Fist is enjoyable if you can get past the fact that it basically rips off The White Stripes' We Are Going To Be Friends. Vicious stomper Girl With One Eye is just embarrassing, with truly dire lyrics capped off with savage production. And Howl just sounds like filler. Anyway, that's the bad stuff out of the way. The rest of the album is brilliant. Cosmic Love has to be one of the most powerful tracks of the year, along with epic single Rabbit Heart (Raise It Up). Opener Dog Days Are Over manages to be sad and uplifting at the same time, with a briliant melody. Other highlights include the dark My Boy Builds Coffins, the propulsive Drumming Song and the Kate-Bush-esque Blinding. De",1,1,"Oct 20, 2009"
10,"Lungs is an amazing album, all the way through. Dog Days Are Over is one of my favorite songs of all time, and Cosmic Love and Rabbit Heart (Raise it Up) are also standout tracks. There is not a song on the album that isn't good, and each one has something unique that pulls you in. Drumming song is instantly catchy and sticks in your head. Girl With One Eye took a while to get used to, but after multiple listens it is just as good as everything else on the CD. None of the songs get old, and i have played this CD more than anything I have ever owned. Definetely one of my favorite albums of all time.",1,1,"Jan 23, 2011"
9,"This is a very heartfelt album. Florence Welch is brutally honest as she sings of violence and coffins and setting beds on fire. Her voice is so beautiful. The opener 'Dog Days Are Over' is a fantastic track. Really opens up the album. Every track sounds great. I must also say the drumming in this album is fantastic. 'Drumming Song' really shows it. All In All, Lungs is a powerful, heartfelt, honest album that's easily one of the best of 2010 as far as indie rock goes. A-",1,1,"Mar 17, 2011"

10,"The album is great. The problem is that with some of this 'fussed over' bands people grow huge expectations, and end up feeling disappointed, when in fact if they were listening to it for the first time they'd probably think it's great too. The sound and the lyrics are very good and original, not to mention her shrilling voice, which is bound to put her well above in the chart of best voices of pop music. It's the first time I at least have thought a harp sounds this good.",1,1,"Jun  7, 2011"
10,"Genre: Pop
One of the most confident debut albums you'll ever listen to there isn't a single bad song to be found on Florence and the Machine's 'Lungs'. As with most great albums there is a nice variety of songs from the frantic pace of 'The Dog Days are Over' to the haunting 'Girl With One Eye'.
Of course with Florence Welch it is all about the remarkable vocals and she never fails to deliver. A true talent.",1,1,"Aug 11, 2013"
8,"(TLDR: This album just needs a little more attention than most, but if you love it it will reward you.) This is a pretty solid album and if you haven't seen the videos, go do it now. (Esp. Drumming Song and Cosmic Love) Florence and the Machine takes a rarely seen approach to composition: in many of her songs, drums are the main interaction with the vocals. Yes, there are other instruments, but in most cases the basic skeleton doesn't require them. On top of which, Miss Welsh has a powerful voice, so it's really that the drums are the *only* instrument that could keep up with her. The album is also strong lyrically, especially with the delicate art of never overstating your point. If I absolutely had to nitpick this album I would say it had two downsides. The first is that the album is *high energy* the whole way through. There are some slow-ER songs, but nothing to give reprieve from the tiring pace.  Unfortunately, this means that if you listen to albums as a whole composition (as you should with any album), you may completely overlook some of the middle of the album songs (Ex. Howl, Between Two Lungs) The second small issue is that sometimes it is difficult to make out the words. However! There is a very simple solution to both of these problems: make as many mixtapes as you possibly can. Put the songs in different contexts, include a lyric book for your chosen loved one (or victim) and leave them to cry their feelings out while driving down the highway, courtesy of one very attractive British redhead and you.",1,1,"Jun 11, 2011"

From the beginning one gets sucked into the dark and seedy world that the film promised, but did not deliver upon. From there the listener goes on a well  crafted musical journey that emulates what should have been delivered cinematically. I think it is fair to say we can all be friends and hate the movie together, but still enjoy the soundtrack. If you don't enjoy at least some parts of this compilation you probably have hearing damage. The music is surprisingly dark and ''unforgiving'. In the violent hour of listening there is enough variation in sound to keep the listener engaged.For a movie about 'werewolves' the soundtrack carries many complex themes and emotions extraordinarily well.

These three outstanding tracks saved the album from a negative review- they are excellent. Each with a different feel, they all showcase the best of Australia's music. In particular, Sweet Disposition, I believe, is the best song by an Australian artist of the decade. This track is worth 16.99 itself, or however much Itunes charges for the album. However, the album has a shocking consistency. It is filled with let-downs. Apart from the aforementioned three songs, this album has nothing. The only reason this album scored so well is due to the simple fact that it has three songs which pull it through, and make the album a worthwhile buy.",0,0,"Mar 14, 2011"

The best thing about this band are that they have a unique and distinctive style and have brought something new to the market. Received great reviews in general, I have to agree for the most part. Only thing I would like is a little more variation in the songs and perhaps a couple of more quicker paced tunes. The last third of the record goes at a crawling pace. Having said that the consistent style across the album is probably one of the main things that make it all sound so well put together and well thought out.

8,"Their music's working best when it's instrumental. I'm not saying their voices are bad but the Intro is the very best song on the whole album and additionally one of the best songs in the year 2009! It's just that their singing isn't necessary. In some songs, yes, but not everywhere. The lyrics are nothing special and especially the woman's voice was importunate to me.

Going from total sadness and longing in the brilliant title-track to the eventual 'moving on' phase in 'Blue Skies' and 'My Door is Always Open,' The Last Days of Spring is the perfect diagram of the emotional turmoil following heartbreak. Every song adds to this overall feeling of the process of getting over love, with massive amounts of drama pumped into every song. One warning: if you enjoyed their debut album, this album is vastly different, and at times even leaves the realm of folk music in the depiction of emotional turmoil, something that may not be a welcome change for you. However, I still recommend you try this album, as you might be surprised and find something even better.",0,0,"Jan 10, 2014"

At the same time, this is easily The Mountain Goats' most musically beautiful album (by mountain goats standards, of course), in spite of the fact that the melodies and rhythms on display here are by and large amongst Darnielle's simplest and most minimalistic. All in all, this was easily among the best albums of 2009, and a fascinating and moving new direction for this consistently fantastic band(Standout tracks: 'Psalms 40:2', 'Genesis 3:23', 'Hebrews 11:40', 'Genesis 30:3', 'Ezekiel 7 and The Permanent Efficacy of Grace')",0,0,"Oct 15, 2010"

8,"Humanoid shows a good amount of musical growth from Tokio Hotel's previous release, Scream. The lyrics on the English version of this album have quite a few horrendously awkward and/or shallow moments, but considering that the band members are from Germany, what can one expect? The lyrics on the German release are much better. The depth of the lyrics has decreased a notch or two from 'Scream,' but that lack is made up for by the electronic elements that were added to the music. There is still room for improvement (mostly in the English lyrics), but Humanoid definitely shows musical progression. On the other hand, most of the bonus songs were terrible. There was a reason those songs didn't make it on the actual album. Now, 'Alien' and 'Phantomrider' weren't bad, but then again, they were real 'album' songs on the German version. The true bonus material - Attention, Down on You, That Day, and Screamin' - were all tinged with the disgusting flavor of over-production and selling out. It should be noted, though, that many of the failures on Humanoid were co-written by The Matrix - a production group that has a tendency towards mainstream pop music. The end result of the collaboration between The Matrix and Tokio Hotel seems to be a failure. The Matrix produces a good deal of amazing pop music and the like, but they just don't merge with Tokio Hotel.
In the end, Humanoid pulls through with wonderful melodies and diversity. All of the songs have a distinct sound, but the album is still cohesive. It's definitely worth a listen. If you find yourself enjoying the sound but not the lyrics, it might help to check out the German edition and a few on-line lyric translation sites.",0,0,"Aug 25, 2010"
10,"If you love rock music and don't care for lyrics then you'll love 'Tokio Hotel's' new album 'Humanoid.' Unfortunately I like music with lyrics so I have to say I'm not really liking this album that much. I much prefer their song 'Don't jump' which tells of a heart warming story of suicide and the music video makes me cry every time.",0,0,"Sep 10, 2010"
10,"One year and 47 listens later, this refuses to lose any of its' punch for me. While it, like its' predecessor, continues to be unable to beat 2007's 'Zimmer 483', it certainly comes closer than 'Scream' in doing so. From start to finish it is an epic saga, covering soft, touching songs like 'Zoom Into Me' which appears later on in the album, and epic rock ballads such as 'Noise' and 'Screamin'', which, respectively, open and close the deluxe edition of the album. Lyrically the album isn't in any sense of the word bad, in fact it's very adequate for a German-to-English translation, however what has improved in instrumental skill and sound has been lost slightly in lyrical ability compared to 'Humanoid''s predecessor. Nonetheless, the album is a perfect example of how Tokio Hotel's general sound and ability have matured over the past three years. It doesn't pull any punches and it certainly doesn't lose any gas from start to finish. A perfect 10/10 despite the few flaws that it does have.

Yes their songs are pop and are typically boy band material but they do have particularly strong vocals which are again shown off pretty well in this album. I like the use of various instruments and some sound effects are present from time to time which adds to the atmosphere of the tracks. I like that this is another album that has quite an uplifting feel to it. It isn't utterly 'sugary sweet', its quite listenable, I don't feel too embarrassed playing the majority of the tracks. I think this time around, they've, for the most part, swapped quantity (track wise) for quality and so having listened to the album in full a few times, im left feeling impressed. This, to me, features the classic Backstreet sound with a modern twist and it isn't as mediocre as their last studio album was, so I would definitely say its worth checking out.

Later the songs are kept in the same climate but they aren't boring in any way. Everyone has got something special, and I can see sth good about every song, even those, that I'm not crazy about like 'Work'.

Songs that perfectly work,  with great riffs and voice-lines, with a classic and both modern sound on the guitars, that makes you feel like if you were at the 70's at the same time you're listen to a 2000's album. There are songs that are, in my opinion, better that other ones at the album, but the definitive result is that this is a recent masterpiece, how Rock have to be done. You don't need something really difficult, only two guitars, a bass, drums, and a great talent of compose direct songs, with this spirit and melody that you can't describe how but it catch you. The same history, but that it still really works, like AC/DC, or Classic Hard Rock bands.",0,0,"Nov  8, 2011"

The songs on this album are held together nicely and it is musically very strong. This album has the heavy moments of Creatures of the Night and Revenge. It also contains the cowbell 70's music of their debut album and later albums and also has many new and interesting songs that many have heard before. The second disc named ,'Kiss Klassics' has strong re-records of their old classics and and have a tight and strong new sound that is one of a kind!

5,"I refused to believe in the hype. I knew this wasn't going to be the 'best KISS album in 30 years', however the promise of an happy band coming off a tour and into the studio excited me. I thought Paul producing was a plus. I thought this one would be a solid to good KISS album and would have been thrilled with that. But like a lot of Gene's & KISS' pronouncements of recent years (New costumes? New Stageshow? Neither looks too new to me fellas) it promises much, but under delivers. I've listened to this album in the car, in the shower, at home, on my iPod thingy, on my PC, loud and soft, to work, from work, long drives and short, in order and random, but it's just not there. Sigh. Look, I didn't get Live to Win either with it's sugary production, soft guitars and saccharine lyrics. It was so sweet and girly it made my teeth hurt, but in retrospect it does show where Paul is at as a producer and artist. So maybe it's me then, maybe I was expecting too much, maybe I've moved on, listening to Metallica and Motorhead and Motley Crue and Tesla and Iron Maiden, listening to these bands of my younger years that have progressed and grown whilst still staying heavy, which it seems KISS haven't on Sonic Boom. Or maybe in trying to capture that 70's sound, they've missed and captured 'old'.
So, on to Sonic Boom. Well it's all a bit... meh really. Sort of like Psycho Circus with the killer opening track that promises so much (Modern Day Delilah and Psycho Circus respectively) but has nothing really to follow it up. Bass sounds magnificent..magnificent i say!, but the guitars.... where are the damn guitars? Some guitars would have been nice. Song wise, this is probably Gene's best material since Creatures of the Night, but killer Paul songs (like the guitars) are absent from the proceedings. If you took the best parts of this, Psycho Circus, A$$hole and Live to Win, you'd have one great KISS album, but Sonic Boom on its own? One, MAYBE two songs you could picture them playing live but that's it, the rest is pretty much filler. Snore.
I always believed KISS had one more killer album in them, but this sure ain't it. 10/10? Nah, it's middle of the road, it's not good, it's not bad, it's Asylum not Creatures of the Night, it's Unmasked, not Destroyer, it's Music From The Elder, not Revenge. It's not a terrible album, its just... meh. . 5/10. Maybe next time hey?

The songs feature a diverse variety of styles even approaching a unexpected 80s punk-pop sound 'Veronica Sawyer Smokes,' a track I dismissed on the first spin but quickly grew to love. The highlights IMHO are Veronica Sawyer, Torch Song, Beautiful Thieves, and my fav, Sacrilege.

One of its brightest moments are 'End Transmission', a seemingly Cure-esque power ballad, and 'Darling, I Want To Destroy You', a generic, but catchy radio-friendly pop rock track.

Other tracks like Vogue, Who's That Girl, Crazy for You and Beautiful Stranger are also tracks which do not appear on studio albums, so it's always good to have them all in one (although I would recommend I'm Breathless). Another good addition is Into the Groove since, as I'm sure most of you are aware, it was left out of the remastered version of Like a Virgin, which is very frustrating, as it is one of her best tracks in my opinion.

Cantrell sings as much in this album as any Alice in Chains album as Duvall is eased into the role of the new lead singer for fans. Highlights include private hell, acid bubble, and a looking in view. The feel of the band has evolved from the heroin addiction they faced in the 90's to a more developed controlled sound that unleashes its fiery on you like a tornado.",4,4,"Jan 16, 2011"

Past albums were always dark but had this quirky life and energy to them. Songs like 'Private Hell' 'Take Her Out' and 'Acid Bubble', just sludge on and go nowhere fast. And I would have loved this record so much more if you could actually, you know, HEAR Duvall on more then 30% of it. Even on Acid Bubble, which Duvall carries VERY well live, Cantrell has to have the prominent voice. What a prick. Cantrell, you had your solo trips, now truely harmonize like AIC used to do so well and make AIC a bit more distinct from your solo stuff.

But still there is the LAYNE factor, no matter how good is William he will never replace Layne, I can just imagine how this songs would've sounded with him.I can't go through the fact that this sounds pretty much like Jerry's single records but with William's back up vocals, for the future if there are any new AiC records, I'd like to hear William in the front, as it was with Layne.",0,0,"Oct 11, 2009"

DuVall is awesome, not quite Layne Staley, but who is. His performance in the band Mad Season proves that. So the fact William DuVall nearly reaches those heights shows that he is a vocalist of great quality. The songs range from dark and moody, typical AIC, to heart rendering ballads, a beautiful tribute to Layne. Buy this album. Don't be close minded.

My only real complaint about this album is that it lacks some of the creativity that could be found in their earlier work. The songs follow a simple pattern of verse, chorus, verse, chorus, Cantrell solo, verse, chorus, etc. and don't really build up to anything or stray away from that mold. Many of their classics took off in another direction and I think that's why they were so different and so much better than a lot of other music at the time.

8,"Alice In Chains. One of the greatest bands i know.With the death of Layne Staley, the band haven't done a album in years.I personally think this was a definitely this was a great comeback album and show they still got their talented Jerry Cantrell as song writer and I think this album is great with their new singer William Duvall.Rip Layne",0,0,"Dec  1, 2010"
7,"The revival of one of the greatest bands of the grunge era returns with more ringing harmonies and guitar solos this time with new headman William Duvall. Although without the limitless and ultra-talented late-Layne Staley, the band continues to make great music with hits such as 'Your Decision,' 'Lesson Learned,' 'Private Hell,' 'Acid Bubble,' and many more. Guitar and vocalist Jerry Cantrell, as well as Sean Kinney and Mike Inez also return to continue the legacy and continuation of grunge in modern music.",0,0,"Jan  5, 2011"

10,"Surprisingly for some, this is probably the best AIC album. Every track has that special touch which makes every bridge or chorus irresistible, even for the non-fan, and positively not turning it into a cheap work in exchange. Jerry Cantrell shows again - and better than ever - why he's the most gifted songwriter and guitar hero from that rainy, unbelievable hometown. William DuVall is a blessing from the heavens and his strong presence in each required situation grants him nothing but admiration. There's no such 'roller coaster' feeling as you travel through the record, what I believe was some kind of 'regular irregularity' present in the previous releases.",0,0,"Dec  8, 2011"

8,"Black Gives Way to Blue is powerful, it uses its prominent bass to fantastic effect, every song has its qualities and it is an album that I regard highly. Some songs are absolutely fantastic, with All Secrets Known being probably the second best Alice in Chains songs Ive heard; but there are a few songs that dont keep up that fantastic quality, and there is a distinct lack of riffs. But the awesome songs along with everything else thats good about the record  from William Duval to its unique sound  makes it a great album. But maybe not quite as good as The Devil Put Dinosaurs Here.

10,"A terrific comeback album by the best grunge band of the 90s, Black Gives Way To Blue is heavier and has greater sludge influences than the earlier albums, but that just adds to the allure. It is the perfect mix of heavy tracks such as 'Check My Brain' and 'A Looking In View', and mellow ones such as 'Your Decision' and 'When The Sun Rose Again'. The title track is a heart-warming tribute to Layne Staley, who will remain in our hearts forever. Will DuVall is a fitting replacement and ensures that there is no decline in quality as far as the music is concerned. All in all, an amazing return. Grunge is back.",0,0,"Sep 12, 2013"
9,"It's always going to be a big challenge to replace a classic band member that was loved by the fans, and even more so to carry on releasing good quality albums and maintaining a level of success. However, Alice in Chains have succeeded in carrying on without fallen bandmate Layne Staley, reforming a few years after his tragic death and hiring vocalist/guitarist William DuVall to take his place in the band. Sure, it's easy to say that you can never really replace someone like Layne Staley, or that 'there's no Alice In Chains without Layne' but this album does nothing but great justice to the legacy of Alice in Chains. Nowhere will you find anything even potentially embarrassing, or anything that might tarnish their good name. This is a comeback that has been done properly.
Now, of course, aside from DuVall, the lineup consists of mainstays guitarist Jerry Cantrell and drummer Sean Kinney, as well as bassist Mike Inez, who joined during the band's original run, replacing original bassist Mike Starr (who, like Layne, is no longer with us today). DuVall fits into his role in the group seamlessly. Most of his vocals are shared with Cantrell, which is no problem at all. Cantrell has always had a strong voice which was becoming a more significant part of the band's sound even when Layne will still there, and also shone through in his solo work. The dual vocal style of the band adds more power and energy to the music overall.
This album maintains pretty much all of the trademark elements of the band's sound, including their dark, moody guitar riffs and their metal sensibility. They sound just as confident as they always have, and have no problem finding their feet even after their many years of dormancy (this is the band's first studio album in 14 years) some of the songs, especially 'All Secrets Known', 'Last of my Kind' and perhaps also 'Acid Bubble' remind me of the albums Dirt and their self titled, and wouldn't sound too out of place on either of those albums. I don't mean that in a bad way. They haven't ripped off those albums, but they sure still have the ability to write the same strong kind of stuff. 'All Secrets Known' for example, is slow moving but heavy, and carries a deterministic feel, which makes for a great album opener. 'Acid Bubble' is also slow, with a sinister feel and some slightly faster, heavier parts throughout.
Alice in Chains have never been a 'happy' band, but there's one fairly upbeat song on here named 'Check My Brain' which is also one of my favourite songs on the album. The guitars are crunchy and dominating, and the vocals and drums are strong enough to accompany them amidst the loudness. On the other end of the spectrum, there are plenty of melancholy, soft moments to be found on the album. While we are provided with many trademark dark songs, the more melancholy parts are a welcome change of pace, and it is because they are done so beautifully that they enhance the listening experience. 'Your Decision' is a sad and eerie mid-tempo song, with orchestral elements and passionately sung vocals. 'Private Hell' is a slower moving song, again with orchestral elements, that takes you on a 5 and a half minute journey of loneliness and despair, sending shivers down your spine.
The title track, which closes the album, provides a suitable final farewell to Layne. Drums are absent, and It features a guest appearance from Elton John on the piano, and creates a haunting atmosphere that sounds ghostly, almost like our lost loved ones are looking down on us from the afterlife. It's difficult for me to express how it makes the listener feel in this review. All I can say is please listen to this song, at least. It's one of the most moving pieces of music you will ever hear.
This album has a lot of standard Alice in Chains fare, but also plenty of surprises thrown in the mix to keep the listener interested, such as percussion and orchestral parts, and songs that sound unlike anything the band has done before. And it should not be forgotten that the material is consistently strong and does the Alice in Chains name justice. It doesn't sound like a typical grunge album, or a typical metal album. It sounds like Alice in Chains being themselves, full of confidence and energy to make a powerful and satisfying comeback album that you can't afford not to have in your collection.

10,"This is a flawless soundtrack, and a damn near flawless standalone record. Everything works. And I wish Karen would do a solo project of just acoustic instruments, mostly just guitar or piano. She has such a lovely voice that is so much more emotional in some of these songs than most of her YYYs songs. The showstopping numbers are the least children album-y, 'Worried Shoes' and 'Hideaway.' The former is a cover of a Daniel Johnston song, but Karen does such a tender, beautiful rendition of it that it definitely becomes the best song here. Runner up is the other ballad, 'Hideaway,' which is actually quite sad lyrically ('My baby is gone...'), but is incredibly beautiful. She has done these crazy antics her whole career, calming down every now and then ('Maps,' 'Dudley,' and 'Little Shadow', so about once each record). But this is unprecedented beauty from Karen. The more upbeat less personal songs work great too ('Capsize,' 'Rumpus,' 'Animal,' and the keening amazing single 'All is Love.') The opening and closing 'Igloo' and 'Sailing Home' (respectively) have the same theme, set to different music, both with her sounding gentle and finally, undeniably inviting.

While it doesn't take many risks, the songs are interesting and catchy, and her soulful voice fits extremely well. The epic sound that makes us feel that her music is performed by a great big band is something many artists and bands wish for; the only ones I've noticed manage it well are Kasabian, Within Temptation and Nightwish. The fact that she has managed it in a Pop album, rather than an alternative or operatic rock album is some feat.Highlights include Stone Cold Sober, New York and Upside Down, which coincidentally are three of the singles she has released from the album. She also puts some effort in more ballad-esque tracks such as Stargazer and Play On, this album seems to be able to please every emotion i wish to take from it.8/10. Why? I bought it on exactly the same day as I bought Lungs by Florence + The Machine. This album, in comparison, falls slightly short of extremely amazing songs.

From soaring classic rockers, Amongst The Waves/Unthought Known, to 'Into The Wild' style ballads, The End and the gorgeous Just Breathe. There's even room for the former 'grunge' act's first ever grunge song - Gonna See My Friend. The two guitarists are given less room for solos, but manage to texture the music beautifully, allowing the rhythm section to really shine (this is the drummer's - Matt Cameron - best perfomance since he joined in 1998).

(a trend that began with another embarrassing tune...LBC) And Brendan O'Brien's production effectively neuters any energy, aggression or emotion that were in the rough cuts of these tunes. Still, it's not a total wash. Highlights include Got Some (sounds very similar to Binaural's Grievance and Insignificance), Johnny Guitar, The Fixer, and the corny, yet enjoyable, Amongst the Waves.

The problem I have with the band's 2000's output is that their albums have a bit too much filler or interesting ideas that are not as fully explored as they could be. This album is more trimmed down and more accessible, but with higher quality songwriting.

9,"It was always going to be a brave decision to use lyrics written by Richey Edwards on a Manic Street Preachers album once again, but the band pulls it off in the only way they know how; by producing an outstanding record. 30 seconds in; following a mean bassline, solid drums, a no nonsense guitar riff from James Dean Bradfield are the lyrics 'the more I see, the less I scream. The figure 8 inside out is infinity'. Sets the tone for the album perfectly. From then on in, almost every song is flawless. The majority with Powerful overdriven Steve Albini guitar sounds, along with huge choruses, raw energy and some of the most relevant and intellectual lyrics of the 21st century. Others such as 'Facing Page: Top Left' and 'William's Last Words' much more mellow. The hidden track 'Bag Lady' is also definitely worth a listen.
For me, this has to be The Manic's best effort since The Holy Bible. Highly recommend it to anybody. (Personal Favourites: Journal For Plague Lovers, Marlon J.D, Pretension/Repulsion)",1,1,"Oct 23, 2014"

Richie's lyrics are both chilling and (strangely enough) life-affirming, and the band seems to be 'together' again, each piece of the puzzle falling perfectly into place.

10,"Well, here it is. The Manics have finally created a worthy follow-up to 1994's The Holy Bible. Don't get me wrong, I love all of the Manics' recorded output, including 2001's Know Your Enemy, which was critically lambasted, as was 2004's Lifeblood, both of which are excellently crafted and highly enjoyable rock and pop records, respectively. However, their greatest achievement until now was the dark and mezmerizing 1994 masterpiece, The Holy Bible. Excellent melodies, disturbing yet poetic lyrics, and guitar virtuosity abound, making this the most memorable document of 'the Richey years.' Now, James, Nicky, and Sean have finally re-opened Richey's folder of lyrics after he has been gone for these 14 years. The result is the greatest album to be released this decade. All of the hallmarks of The Holy Bible are there: reversed Rs on the cover, Jenny Saville artwork, Richey's tormented lyrics, abrasive guitar riffs and fills, as well as JDB's half-shouted, half-sung vocals (yet always melodic). As I have already said, I think this album is the greatest album of the decade and an even bigger step-up from 2007's Send Away The Tigers. Bottom Line: If you are a fan of music, you need this album.

Journal for Plague Lovers was the album the Manics had to make if they wished to remain relevant and vital for the next decade onwards. It's a fantastic blend of Richey's thoughtful lyricism and the band's natural knack for melody.

I definitely got the indie-esque feel for the album after about the second listen all the way through, and loved every minute of it. Though it may not be the best album of 2009, it could definitely be a favorite. Give it a few listens and you will see how well Yorn's masterful instrumentals and lyricism mix with ScarJo's organically sexy voice.

The album does suffer from some weak moments, especially Guiding Light seemed to lack anything to make it stand out among the tracks and coupled with I Belong to You could leave fans wishing for a heavier sound disappointed. The pre-hyped 13 minute symphony Exogenesis that finishes of the album is unfortunately not one of it's strongest moments either but it is quite beautiful in parts and doesn't feel forced or there for just for the sake of it but instead feels very much part of the album. While the over the top theatrics might not suite everyone fans of Muse wanting more prog than rock should not be let down by this album.",2,2,"Sep 16, 2009"
10,"This album has all the trade-mark variety of Muse's past albums, demonstrating their ability to experiment and succeed in a number of genres whilst maintaining their distinctive sound.

It's a breath-taking trip that unfortunately not everyone will appreciate.",2,2,"Sep 17, 2009"

The exogenesis symphony is remarkable and a few catchy singles make it more enjoyable then it's predesccor.

8,"I'm a huge Muse fan, and so the reason I only gave it an 8 is that they can do better. Their first 3 albums were phenomenal, but Black Holes and this aren't quite up to par. Notable exceptions are Knights of Cydonia in Black Holes, and the Exogenesis series in this album, which are some of their best work. However, this album is amazing compared to 90 percent of what's out their! Can't wait to see them live.",2,2,"Sep 16, 2009"

8,"Muse love taking risks, it seems. With The Resistance, and the recent 2nd Law, Muse have expanded their musical range and compensated some fans along the way. Though as a proud lover of Muse (especially their earlier music, Origin of Symmetry being their masterclass in music), The Resistance is one of their poorer releases, and that goes without question. Forgetting the Exogenesis Symphony (beauty defined), The Resistance has some risky releases from Muse, but still managed to be a solid release worthy of a 7 at bare-minimum for effort, and risk factor.
Opening with the wonderfully powerful, clearly messaged Uprising, a progressive rock anthem designed for the heights of stadium tours, The Resistance seems promising. Gritty guitars, sci-fi electronics, the works. Then comes Resistance, a song so worthy of single material, it goes without saying that Resistance is a solid track. Undisclosed Desires follows, an experimental track setting the boundary for singles the follow, including Madness from The 2nd Law. One of the weaker tracks, Undisclosed Desires is a love-or-hate piece. Personally, I feel the album track is fine, though live it falls to Matt's ego.
The album then take a small turn into piano-induced territory, with the brilliant (and Queen-influenced) United States of Eurasia. A beautifully striking piece, with some mastery piano work, one could never dislike such a perfect design. Though potentially ruining the flow of the album and making it difficult to progress, this is one track which will surely go down in history as one of Muse's finest pieces. Though followed with Guiding Light, we're back into cheese territory. Undoubtedly a difficult track to sit through, Guiding Light is a mess, with extra helpings of brie.
Now we're thrown back into the heavy stuff, with the flawless Unnatural Selection and the meaty MK Ultra, both driven by ridiculous but catchy riffs, impressive vocals, superbly arranged lyrics, and powerful bass surely to impress even the masters of rock. Two amazing tracks worth of Muse acclaim, and definitely some of the greatest works Muse have thrown out there in a good few years. This is what Muse are made of, right here. We're thrown into the deep end yet again, however, with I Belong To You, a piece so ridiculously out of proportion, you're not sure what to think. Personally, I think it's great. A fun track not meant to be taken seriously. Then we're given the Exogenesis Symphony, a beautiful, flawless, three-piece symphony of piano, strings, guitar and stunning vocals. If not the greatest achievement of Muse since Citizen Erased, a perfect end to a great album overall.
The Resistance won't be to everyone's liking, but it has elements so magical, it can easily put you under a spell. Whatever that spell may be, of course. You'll either love The Resistance, or despise it.
Overall Score: 8/10",2,2,"Dec 20, 2012"
8,"After a long journey in search of finding and inhabiting new worlds, we've finally done it. We can proudly call ourselves free and never look back to the past or maybe we should just once, while telling our offspring the glorious story or how we got to where we are now. No better way to do that then to play The Resistance. A masterpiece by muse, even though it is, by some, founded awful, pretentious and well, too much, is conquering the walls that our minds have, those that have to be shattered. A love story, a story that hides the codes of our salvation, is engraved into this musically wonderful album that one, who has any interest in serious music or isn't so overly obsessed with radiohead that he/she disses every step muse make, can't deny. This symphonic blessing slaps you so hard in the head it is tough to realize the minor flaws it has to offer. But all is forgotten, if there is something to forgive, when the symphony arrives. The Exogenesis is the best, most beautiful, pretentious (this, when describing muse, is somehow a good thing - and well it is) piece of music The resistance has to offer. It is definitely the most profound piece of music I've heard in the previous decade, not exaggerating. It's surely not in my interest to slam everyone else nor am I so obsessed with them that I can't hear the real deal, but hearing this song gives you the chills you could only experience while your invocation is being answered. Maybe I am talking too much about it but this is one of the best songs ever written. Other highlight is the United states of Euroasia. This wonderful song is brought to the heights of grandeur and sumptuosity by it's instrumental, let's call it, chorus. With influences from Queen, muse have, kind of,  established a more artistic version of art rock. The songs aiming just as high, but incapable of reaching them are I belong to you, Uprising who are not bad but are lacking some elements to make them ready for shipment. This album, maybe not as good as the previous three, contains the very best work modern music could offer us, in many minds covered by clouds and fog which are disabling them to hear it.

9,"When I see some of the ratings of the album of today like Wu-tang Clan having a 9/10 or a Nelly Furtado's 10/10..... and I see people talking about muse saying: what are they trying to do with their album ?? Why are they? Who are They? ....I'm kind of worried about the future of the music....About how would it look like. First, let me know that most of the albums of today are singing using the famous Auto-tune. NOt only rappers! lots of singers. But when I say a little band from Teighnmouth, growing up by using a bit of pop influence to do their song, and trying to be known by some media, and singing for real on stage and using real instruments.... and now decided by themselves: Ok, now it's time to shake their heads and show what we can! ....and they put out Resistance. Why do people don't like this album? Because they thought Muse would be a little more poppier, try to do songs that would be able to be heard on a radio....sadly Muse isn't completely this. I agree yes that Undisclosed Desires is a radio-friendly songs, but that doesn't change at all the rest of the album! Can you expect from some other bands in the world a complete symphony like Exogenesis? Would you expect to have an album that tries to push the boundaries and limts of what you call a ''rock music'? Muse are not made to play rock, Muse are made to play music, in all sense, and that's what defines Muse. Rather than talking about how cool they are, how many girls they got in their party, how many drugs they can sell, how many hearts they have break or lost, Muse stand up and tries to search far more than their little noses. On the other hand, there is some songs or parts of songs that I have difficulty with, but in overall this album is a classic. Queen was hated when they alive, now they are praised. I guess it will be the same......sadly.",2,3,"Sep 15, 2009"
10,"Its magical music. Can't stop listening. United States of Eurasia and Exogenesys Symphony RULEZZZZ.",2,3,"Nov  1, 2009"
10,"Remarkable. Resistance is...futile. It's iIn the Lap of the Gods! Oh; am I alluding to Queen? How dare they pay homage to Queen, you say? Blast you! Amazing that they're the only band on earth capable of sounding remotely like Queen, you say? Bless you! But they're not of THIS earth.",2,3,"Nov 26, 2009"
10,"The new album my Muse is an instant classic in my book. I find myself wondering if The Resistance is my favorite album of all time, which is not an easy task. I suggest all to listen to it and keep an open mind. The Exogenesis Symphony at the end of the album is one of the best pieces of music I have ever heard as well.",2,3,"Nov 26, 2009"
8,"Excellent Album. The Resistance is a very different album compared to prior albums, it taps into different genres in general and a little less the simple Rock style from the previous. Muse fans that loved the prior sound may not embrace this as favorably. This album is has a bit of orchestra / broadway / musical style tracks which include; Resistance, United States of Eurasia, Guiding Light, and the Exogenesis tracks are filled with beautiful vocals from Matthew Bellamy which I found entracing. Worth a good listen, but don't expect this to be a ROCK album.",2,3,"Dec 18, 2009"
10,"I think that most of the reason people who rate this album low do so is because they expected something different. To be fair, I wouldn't say that The Resistance is a rock album, although Muse is a rock band. While songs like Uprising, MK Ultra, and Unnatural Selection are rock songs, the other songs are blends of genres with rock, sometimes with only a hint of rock. That being said, this album is amazing and is proof of Muse's versatility, musicality, and creativity. It's also a very well sequenced album with a story: while each song has its own story to tell, they also are pieces that form a meta-story. While it might not be my favorite Muse album, I think it is probably the best made album. I think the biggest weakness of the album is that it feels incomplete without every element, i.e. it almost needs to be listened to exclusively in entirety. It's not really a single heavy album. This is especially evident in the last three songs, the Exogensis Symphony. Listening to any of those songs without the other parts isn't really enjoyable. The Resistance is an awesome album, just as Muse is an awesome band. Listen to the entire album without expectations and you'll leave it satisfied.",2,3,"Dec 31, 2009"
8,"There are some excellent parts to this album, notably the Exogenesis Symphony, the sleek Undisclosed Desires, United States of Eurasia and MK Ultra; but you get the feeling that Muse are trying to do too much and cover too many genres, which backfires in several songs, notably Guiding Light and IBelong to You. Still, it makes for an entertaining listen, and it is still definetely worth buying the whole album. However, it lacks the cutting edge of Black Holes of Revelations, and the originality and cohesion of Origin of Symmetry and Absolution in particular. Muse had a unique sound, but they are trying to hard to combine the style of other successful acts (notably Queen, Depeche Mode and U2) into their work. It appears Muse are unsure of their identity.",1,2,"Dec  3, 2009"
10,"I'm a big fan of Muse and although I was a bit disappointed by Black Holes and Revelations, I liked that album quite a bit all the same. This one is fantastic, I personally rate it just under Absolution (which is my favourite 2000's album by anyone). The only weak point is Guiding Light, which should've been cut off. Other than that, a marvellous record, with a lot of high points (my favourites are Resistance and Unnatural Selection). Takes a few listens to truly appreciate.",1,2,"Oct 26, 2009"
10,"It is amazing...mixes sounds of OoS and Black holes.",1,2,"Sep 15, 2009"
8,"Their resistance was good, even with their uprising!! Best songs ad album ever by Muse! I've only heard like 5 songs, and out of those 5 songs I must say: Excellent and well done! Awesome rock songs going on with Muse",1,2,"Aug 18, 2010"
8,"this album is Muse's best. I had never heard of them until this album came out, and I was surprised at how good they were. Some people will just buy uprising, resistance, and undisclosed desires, but if you want the full experience, go buy the whole album.",1,2,"Sep  5, 2010"
7,"The most classically themed album from the Devon trio, it falls heavily from being unoriginal, unexciting and uninspired but does manage to keep Muse's over the top attitude towards their own work which still makes it a worth while listen.",1,2,"Sep 20, 2010"
5,"Only the three first songs is worth listening to.",3,9,"Jan 24, 2010"
6,"After Black holes & revalations i wondered if muse had lost it but they came back with an un-appreciated masterpiece. ignore Uprising and this is not commercialised one bit.Truly Great",1,3,"Sep 17, 2010"
2,"I was a big fan of Muse. Origin of Symmetry and Absolution were on repeat for a long time on my iPod. I thought they were incredibly creative in previous albums with their own style and their own effects. Black Holes & Revelations was disappointing except for 'Knights of Cydonia' which probably has the best outro riff on guitar EVER. But with The Resistance its just a band that has run out of inspiration and is turning to mainstream and the simplicity of the songs, but still trying to be like the old muse. the mixture is AWFUL. like other people have said, the entire album sounds like Dr. Who mixed with queen...i'm only giving it a 2/10 because 'Undisclosed Desires' is the only acceptable song on the album.",1,4,"Jan 25, 2010"
3,"I love Muse but i didn't love this. I tried, really. It's Muse trying hard to be Muse. Tying hard to say something meaningful, trying hard to say something clever. But in every track i cant help but hear a second rate version of some classic song or band ... White Wedding, Queen, Marylin Manson. I had to turn it off and it's not making it to my iPod. I'll wait until Matt and the boys come back to earth with their next record.",1,4,"Oct  9, 2009"
3,"I wanted to like this album, but alas, there isn't one song on here that is even remotely as good as their back catalog. It seems more like a collection of mediocre B-Sides than a proper album. An excellent example of a band trying too hard to say something that isn't really poignant to begin with.",1,4,"Nov  9, 2009"
1,"I don't see how people can like this album. It's a disgrace to MUSE,who have put out such great music in the past. The resistance feels like they have run out of ideas, and put out some half-assed stuff because they know it will sell, good or not. The first track, Uprising, feels like a knock-off of their earlier work, repetitive, and dull. Resistance isn't even good music. It is not enjoyable to listen to. It sounds generic at best. Undisclosed Desires continues a trail of mediocrity. It's a song that blends into the background all to easily. United States Of Eurasia takes clear inspiration from Queen, and yet still manages to be horribly dull and uninspired. Guiding Light, Unnatural Selection and MK Ultra are alright, but nothing special. I belong to you wraps up this story of dullness. Then we get the exogenesis parts, which are even more unlistenable. I found it hard to find the words to describe this album. Do I rate it more harshly because it is MUSE? Yes. It should be so much better. This album just doesn't deliver.",1,4,"Oct 20, 2009"
3,"I was really disappointed by this album, because I wanted to hear Muse. All I got was a compilation of some very obvious influences; namely, Queen.",1,4,"Nov  3, 2009"
3,"Honestly, I wanted to like Muse. But again, most of the songs just not fit in, or feel like rock 'n' roll songs. I can't really see how Muse can be a 'rock band' with all those electro/techno noises coming from around while playing the guitar and drums. Rock is about the passion and groove and what I hear at Muse is just a fail attempt at rock. Also, the singer's voice isn't really the best one I ever heard. But again, most rock bands sound like this nowadays, which is really sad. You can rate this review as unhelpful, because you are either a Muse fan or someone who likes this kind of music, but you're turning your backs to what rock 'n' roll should sound like. AC/DC? The Rolling Stones? Van Halen? Cream? Jimy Hendrix? Do these ring any bell?",1,4,"Sep 30, 2010"
4,"The most disappointing album of the year for me. I'm a huge Muse fan and love their past work, but this album seems uninspired and phoned-in. Matt Bellamy's blistering guitar riffs are almost non-existent, the lyrics are generic dour, and too many songs sound like rip-offs of past artists or older Muse songs. The only saving grace of this album is the 3-part Exogenesis Symphony, which is stunningly beautiful. My advice: buy the Symphony on iTunes and hope Muse returns to their roots for their next album.",1,5,"Jan  2, 2010"
2,"It was apparent Muse would never release another album of 'Origin of Symmetry' calibre when 'Black Holes and Revelations' came out, but I had no idea they could sink THIS low.",1,5,"Sep 20, 2009"
2,"It is truly amazing how one band can go from furious, honest, passionate, aggressive, but often beautiful music to this sell-out, rip-off, sickening piece of pointlessness. This is one of the cheapest, laziest, most revolting albums I've ever heard, and from a band I worshipped as a teenager. It makes me sick. Not one original moment, and in particular the singles are totally hollow, lifeless, chart-seeking objects of utter shame (hopefully) for the band. 1.8 points awarded for 'MK Ultra' and some memorable moments, like the first minute of 'Resistance' (that is, before it shamelessly and ridiculously explodes into dancing on poor Freddie Mercury's grave, just like - oh I shudder to even say it - United States of Eurasia), and 0.2 points for sheer effort, particularly in 'Exogenesis' (but then again, it's always seemed to me that, because Bellamy starting writing the symphony long before the other songs, the rest of the album could just be filler, to make more money out of releasing his 'work of genius'). But, I was right, unfortunately, about 'BH&R' - that Bellamy was forgetting about the music and letting his immature obsession with very vague and half-hearted themes of opression, conspiracy take over, and blah, blah, blah, I'm boring myself even writing this. What a terrible album. I'm off to listen to the 'Dead Star / In Your World' EP I just bought and sing along with the words 'MUSE DIED AFTER ABSOLUTION, MUSE DIED AFTER ABSOLUTION...'",1,5,"Feb  7, 2011"

4,"Any band that manages to copy Queen, Radiohead, My Chemical Romance, and System of a Down in one album kinda deserve an award. It would be an award for being terrible, but an award nonetheless. Muse have none of the bombast, none of the emotion, none of the logic stitching together their harebrained dystopian worldview that made their past two albums so incredibly good. As long as that is missing, Muse will never be a good band. Two bands I love called Pure Reason Revolution (prog rock) and Innerpartysystem (electronic rock) released albums in the last 2 years that sound remarkably like Resistance, so I recommend them instead. I wholeheartedly believe Muse copied off them and did it poorly!",0,3,"Sep 18, 2009"

0,"Probably, Matt Bellamy thinks it: They're the new kings of progressive rock of the 2000s but this is so crap, they hurt a great Chopin's musician composition and in this Symphonies? are a big fake (its a mediocre copy of some Mono's song), and a terrible copy of Queen, mixed with marylin manson, queens of the stone age (check Uprising) and call us ART ROCK, come on people!

10,"If you like Juanes, Julieta Venegas (who is a guest in 2 songs), or are a fan of Nelly and her voice you'll love this cd. If you don't love her voice then Maybe you should be listen to it from a friend because I know some people consider her voice to be an acquired taste(though I don't know why because I love it and think it is so unique, as an aspiring singer, I'm jealous of her voice!!) I've listened to it 3 times since buying it last night and my favorite songs so far are: Vacacion, Suficiente Tiempo, Fuerte, Como Lluvia, Mas, Bajo otra Luz, Feliz Cumpleanos and the hidden track. Well that's almost the whole cd and I'm sure that the other songs will become favorites soon. With Loose it took a while for me to like-no-looove the songs because when I heard the cd 4 the 1st time, I just didn't like it unlike her previous work which I loved immediately, but I know that eventually this cd will be one that I can't stop listening to.

2,"I wonder if people bought the album if it wasnt by Nelly Furtado. It was very, very mediocre. Makes her last album Loose look very good, and that was already not good for Nelly standards. People always say, that Nelly tries different things with every album, but this time her new songs are just...boring. And its not because I dont speak spanish, but because the music is just so simple and dull. And, even more surprising, Nelly has no soul or any passion on this album. She has delivered better vocals on her other records. Its a record youll hear while on vacation when you have a drink at the beach bar and relax. From an artistic point of view it is pretty bad. People that only liked Loose by Nelly, will be disappointed. Even hardcore fans will be disappointed, not all, but many like me. Nelly has arrived in the mainstream pop business, and now she follows her female collegues by recording boring pop music.",0,0,"Sep 17, 2009"
4,"I have to say that, Mi Plan unfortunately really rather boring. I love Nelly, love most of her songs and her former styles from whoa nelly to loose, so not just loose. my fave album was folklore from her, because, i felt that, she expressed the best herself on it. And when i heard that album, i thought: wow! a really amazing person with unique style and voice! and i couldnt wait for her new album, mi plan. Manos al aire was a special song, a great mixture and i thought: if mi plan will just like good as the first single, then this album will BE AWESOME. but after this good single, i began to be disappointed. ms was romantic, but too slow, in bajo otra lz just the chorus part was liked and it was a similar situation with mi plan single too. so, theres 3 song on the album, what i really like: manos al aire, fuerte and suficiente tiempo. thats all. i think, that was the problem, that nelly want to release a superfantastic spanish album, and thats good, that nelly really enjoyed the album-making, but i miss the dynamic, interesting and excitin songs. and i also think, she doesnt provide the voice-capacity, what we accustom from her, because her audios are very weak. Nelly, your next album let be much melodious and exciting, please! and i think, these mistakes arent the consequences of the language borders, just this album too relaxing to be hiter.",0,0,"Sep 23, 2009"

I certainly can see both points of view with this band: those who are charmed by their ragged garage band tunes and sunny girl-group harmonies and those who find VG to be below par due to their seeming lack of musical chops. The truth probably lies somewhere between these two camps, but for those who enjoyed the debut this album has plenty going for it. The material does seem to tilt to the darker side, but much of the music is bright and peppy. It is ragged (in a good way) and I think any comments suggesting VG are amateur are patently unfair. I know plenty of amateur musicians who couldn't pull off what VG do. These girls know what they are doing and I for one look forward to following their career arc because I think the best is yet to come for VG. As for the haters, move on because this album will only bolster how you already feel about them which is your loss, IMO.

She shines as a pop star with tracks like Masquerade, Crank It Up, How Do You Love Someone and the single It's alright, It's ok. Acting out is quite an excellent track as an introduction to the album, but the volume of her voice can be a bit too loud. The other tracks are actually not bad, they can be enjoyable once in a while, they just can't stand on their own. Yet, Ashley surprisingly did an album that stays on the same style without never getting repetitive or an annoying song.",0,1,"Sep 28, 2010"

1,"Tisdale's sophomore album sounds as if it arrived to pop, two years two late. The production all sounds recycled. Perhaps if she weren't scraping the bottom of the Dr. Luke  Max Martin barrel for b-sides so pathetic, not even Skye Sweetnam or Fefe Dobson recorded them. 'Hot Mess' is perhaps the best and most original track, in that it cheekily describes Tisdale's desperation in an autobiographical lyric play. But still, grasping for originality in a track straight from the gutter out of Avril Lavigne's do not record pile.  Tisdale has no identity, and will remain unknown in the music world, aside from playing Sharpay Evans on High School Musical.",0,1,"Sep  1, 2013"
9,"Ashley Tisdale's first album 'Headstrong' started off in a rough spot commercially. Either no one took the time to hear it, or Ashley didn't take the time to promote it fully with shooting of 'High School Musical 2' around that same time. Afterwards, she made up the rest of the promo duties in October of 2007. After earning a Gold certification at 471,000 copies sold, it didn't make a giant impact. But it wasn't a disaster like we quickly assumed considering that it sounded similar to the failed debut album that Diana DeGarmo put out.
Now in the year 2009, Ashley might have went to the same hairstylist that DeGarmo had and came out a brunette. But that's not her only change. Her second album 'Guilty Pleasure' takes on the pop/rock sound with the electrorock subgenre, which was different from the first album. With the exception of the Timbaland-ish 'Crank It Up', the entire album is jammed in the middle between the Hilary Duff/Lindsay Lohan teen rock from Disney's past and the Miley Cyrus/Selena Gomez electronic pop/rock from Disney's present.
The 'High School Musical' breakout, whose vocals still aren't as powerful as Demi Lovato's, sounds scattered on 'It's Alright, It's OK'. Limping from note to note to high note and sounding like Kidz Bop covering 'So What', the album's first single doesn't make a giant mistake like it wanted to. As much as she tries to show her growth, the vocals sound constrained, and the amazement is not there. Tisdale hasn't even gotten a handle on the slow ballads yet. On 'What If', she struggles to shake off the Broadway pitch for 'American Idol' judge Kara DioGuardi's soft tune. It comes across as an outtake from the 'High School Musical 3' soundtrack as well as a sequel to the wobbly ballad 'Unlove You' from her debut album.
When listening to the lyrics on 'Hair', those who miss the blonde ambition she had with Sharpay Evans and Maddie from 'The Suite Life of Zack & Cody' will find it hard to endure through the full song. Also sounding like a bad pun, 'Hot Mess' is a decent track, but considering what didn't impress already, the album could have been either summed up as a hot mess or made into a more appropriate title for this album until the rest of the album is played.
Listeners are prone to doubt the potential of Disney stars but have never counted out Ashley. As you listen to 'Overrated' you can somehow identify it as a top 40 ready smash that would have made a better first single than 'It's Alright, It's OK'. Ashley could have also substituted in 'Masquerade'. This radio-friendly jam sounds pitchy when sung live, but it gives Ashley room to grow as a vocalist. She comes out swinging toward the end of the album with knockouts like 'Me Without You' and 'Switch'.
In a typical discussion, Tisdale is often labeled as the fabricated Disney tycoon instantly, but Tisdale's showbiz record has less in common with everyone else than anyone takes the time to notice. While she had her first encounter with Disney at the regular starting age of 13, her first appearance in a Disney product was in the 1998 Pixar film 'A Bug's Life'. While every other Disney star was still a teenager at their breakthrough, Tisdale turned 21 when 'High School Musical' took off. While all of her good Disney friends got record deals from Hollywood Records, Ashley made a bold decision by signing to Warner Bros. Records. It may not get her videos on YouTube due to the label's feud with that website, but they supported every decision Ashley went with. Most of these songs flow better than the first single, and she finishes this round feeling like a champion.",0,1,"May  4, 2014"

10,"'People Say' is a great song to start the album on. From there the transitions from song to song flow immaculately. makes it really easy to hit hit play and listen to the whole album in one shot. can't say much for 'Work All Day'. the message is pretty simple; don't get stuck in a rut where you work all day and all night and have no time for a life, and eventually you die sad and lonely. 'Lovers in Love' is, in my opinion, the best song on the album by far. Percussions and violin add to the fast paced nature of the song. has a great story, I feel like I could break the law to this song and get away with it (but I won't). After that, is popular Portugal. the man song, 'The Sun'. I was impressed with this song for a few reasons, the harmonious singing was very well done, especially at 1:45 into the song where the guitar adds a generous boost of good feelings for the song and the singers.The Synth adds nicely to the structured chaos towards the end of the song. I recommend this song as a first listen for Portugal. The Man. It makes you feel great. 'The Home' is my least favorite song on the album. It's relatively slow, unlike the rest of the album and the guitar solo kills it for me, it sounds flat and uninteresting (no offence to anyone who likes happens to like the song). 'The Woods' is a bad-ass song to make love to. the triangle stroke at the end of the drum line always caught my attention and I begun to enjoy it. Vocals and bass work very nicely together, vocals are the best in this song on the album. I wish 'Guns & Dogs' was longer cause its a great example of the style of the album. It's mellow and retro and holds an 'in your face' attitude. 'Do You' has a great story to it, I find it to be a little religious but I don't think the intention is to promote Christianity, rather the nature of the song. The third verse in the song provides a key-changing resolution for the rest of the song. Great part. 'Everyone is Golden' starts nicely, but then by the chorus it gets a little dry for me with its stop and go melody which follows to the end. Not one of the better songs on the album. The next song, 'Let You Down', was a nice piece, it doesn't follow the rest of the album however. I feel like it should have been better truly acoustic rather than using small time, cheap effects. That's just me though. 'Mornings' is a very subtle song. Again, the use of small time add in and cheap effects in some parts. However, a very interesting guitar part presents itself around 1:30 and then another solo at 2:50 comes graciously in sweeps you away. This album never got the recognition it deserves and neither does Portugal. The Man.

9,"An exclamation of Americana, Megafaun's 'Gather, Form & Fly' brings into harmony much of the music that has transformed our ears in decades past. Driven forth by guitar, banjo, a mesmerizing set of percussive poetry and the occasional mix of keys and horns, each track effectively builds upon the last, and moves with a swelling tide of emotion. The album's title track, essentially a 3 minute-long instrumental piece with a short set of lyrics that hark back to band's Northern roots (North wind sayin', 'It's time / to find the summer sky / before the leaves all die / gather, form and fly'). The instrumental introduction of the song, however, is the blazing leaf in the sea of a golden deciduous autumn. It weaves a delicate harmony that is brought, at times, to a sudden halt and silence, then is reanimated with further vigor and lust for life, changing the overall tone ever so slightly, and in just the perfect increments to construct such an elegant tune. This motif of change is what makes this album so rock-solid and full of never-ending surprise. 'Impressions of the Past,' another largely instrumental track, is a testament to the band's roots in jazz, and also to their position in contemporary rock. After shattering their masterful 2-minute long jam with a squealing bow and a crash of cymbal, the song collapses, reconstructs itself and sings with triumph as it begins to run for the hills, leaving you to wonder, 'Where has this band been all my life?' No modern album wouldn't be complete without a sing-a-long style crowd builder like 'Guns,' which also contemporarily breaks down into a Wilco-esque (think 'Poor Places') hum and drone of bowing cymbals, haunting vocals, and electronic squeals. It is also followed by another prerequisite, a solemn closing song, 'Tides,' which brings the album full circle, back into the beautiful harmonies that this band builds itself upon. 'Gather, Form & Fly,' is nothing short of a glorious accomplishment for a band that is sure to produce far more brilliant work in the years to come.

9,"As much as I admire all of Jack White's projects, I've found that - as a music fan - I've never found any sonic unity in any White Stripes or Raconteurs album (the exception here being the Stripes' amazing 'Elephant'). The Dead Weather, however, proves to be the anti-Raconteurs in that it strays away from the poppishness of both of White's previous bands. To certain people, though, this is also a downside. But if you're a fan of a unified sound style and the unique sort of artistic expression one can find in the 'format' of a well-planned and self-referencing album (Arcade Fire's 'Neon Bible' or Sufjan Steven's 'Illinoise', for example) then you'll find much more merit in this album than the average person might. 'Horehound' - and the Dead Weather, I suppose - is a nice way for Jack White to round out his current discography. The album brings something fresh to the table, a sort of funk-goth-alt-rock designed for the hardcore, and The Dead Weather deserves to be praised for it.",0,0,"Jul 18, 2009"
9,"The Dead Weather is better than White's other side project The Raconteurs. It's a lot stranger than anything Jack White has ever done before. Sounds different from The Raconteurs and doesn't even come close to The White Stripes. But everything about this album sounds great. 'I Cut Like A Buffalo' is a strange, blues jam that is just great. 'Treat Me Like Your Mother' is another great track. Allison Mosshart's vocals sound amazing. All In All, The Dead Weather's debut album Horehound is a great album that needs to be listened too.

10,"Probably one of the best dance albums of all time, the album starts and ends with the same vocalists and really shows his vocal ability (the first song features an extensive use of autotune whilst the final track has a beautiful acoustic voice with backing vocals by the two band members). Every song is beautifully crafted and produced which shows how much emotion was put into the album. Daft Punk's first album Homework was meant to be one of the most influential dance albums ever, but I think Discovery tops that.",1,1,"Jun 29, 2012"
10,"Though many could consider Homework or Random Access Memories their milestonesHomework for contributing to modern electronic music (and simply because it's their debut album) and RAM for its commercial breakthrough and refinement to an era of EDM where everyone wants to be David GuettaDiscovery is truly where it all began, in my opinion. Not just the beginning of Thomas Bangalter and Guy-Manuel de Homem Christo's robotic alter egoscaused by a September 9th, 1999 accident in their studio, ahem. But the beginning of an era where electronic music began again. Discovery could be considered a main highlight in the early noughties, with 'One More Time' being noteworthy as one of the greatest singles of the decade and 'Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger' being sampled by Kanye West then remixed into their Alive tour, however, it's just a work of art in its own right, disregarding Pitchfork and all that praised it in their year-end lists.
Technically speakingif I spoke from my own fangirl alter ego, I'd simply say 'This album is **** amazing' and nothing elseDiscovery has a polished production that's almost insulting for the simple fact that it's samples layered upon samples, which would later end up being sampled by other artists. And yet it's all original in its own right, especially considering the obscurity of the samples chosen. It's obviously not a concept album, but to recommend single songs off of the album seems impossible, considering it'd strip the mood from when you listen to it on continuous play. From the sappy, feel-good vibes in its lead single and 'Digital Love' to the funky, chill vibes in 'Something About Us', it's astonishing how cohesive a dance album can actually be. To sum it all up, it's amazing, there.",1,1,"Sep 19, 2014"

9,"I think this is an excellent album.  In fact, it's so good, I'm confused about the Pitchfork review that gave it 4.1 stars.  Yes, I agree, Ebert has reemerged with a different style lead singer than he was with Ima Robot, but so what?  How is this any different than the Beatles starting the 60's with a rather clean cut (if somewhat moppy-headed) aura and ending in the late 60's with long hair and beards, ushering in Eastern religion into the cultural milieu of the day?  Big deal.  People change.  Artists change.  Most lasting musicians reinvent themselves several times throughout their career.  In fact, the mark of a musician that does typically last is his/her inability or unwillingness to reinvent his/her personal presentation.  So now that we've gotten that out of the way, and we're facing the truth that musicians do actually make music to succeed, and in order to succeed, they have to sell albums, let's turn to the music.  I'll get the hard part out of the way.  This band is clearly not trying to fit in with the modern 'acceptable range' of music (Arcade Fire, Florence + the Machine, etc) today, which mostly deals in cutting looks at the negatives we see in the world today.  Their '1960's hippie' feel in 2010 simply shows their courage to display something different.  I'm not too happy with the 'messianic' presentation of 'Edward Sharpe' he's painted, but leaving that behind, the music is simply stellar.  This is a well-studied reinterpretation of 1960's psychedelic folk rock.  It's one of the most laid back albums in that genre that you're going to find, that doesn't go overboard with an unusual obsession for Bob Marley, the Beatles, or any other major root.  They show an honest respect for their predecessors without sounding repetitive or too focused on one influence or another.  In other words, they're original, without being too original, and they've aimed for, and successfully recreated the sound of an era, presenting it in a way that is palatable to the modern ear.  There's not a single song on this album that is going to grate on your nerves.  To be honest, the album leaves you feeling happy and relaxed.  If you're looking for a sharp dystopian outlook on suburban life, or a depressing analysis of modern information overload, look elsewhere, there's none of that here.  There's a playful innocence to this album that is as happy as the Weepies, without sounding too saccharin at the same time.  My guess is that many who reviewed this album were simply not approaching it with an open mind.  So many recent albums that have come out recently are based around a sharp, sometimes biting analysis of the woes of the current economic crisis or the seeming lack of authenticity in the world today, that we've adjusted our palettes to hear this kind of music.  Expect good music from this album, and listen to it on a day when you're not trying to find misery as your best company, and you'll find yourself pleasantly surprised.",0,1,"Dec  4, 2010"

The drumwork on display is among the finest I've heard in a long time, and the Nils Edenloff's Mangum-esque vocals only serve to hammer home the pain, joy, heartbreak, and memory that is so pervasive throughout this album. In short, this is THE definitive summer album of the past few years, possibly the best summer album since Wilco's Summerteeth.

8,"A great debut from a very promising band. 'Don't Haunt this Place' and 'In the Summertime' in particular are two of my favorite tracks from 2008. The album's only significant flaw is that the two weakest tracks, 'The Air' and 'Sleep All Day' (both of which, in my opinion, probably could have just been cut) are slotted one after another, smack in the middle of the album; needless to say, this sequencing really disrupts the record's flow.

Great pop riffs/lines, superb arrangements. On the top of all this, you can even learn cricket if you didn't have the chance to (outside the irish-british world is not that common).
Special mention to 'Meeting Mr. Miandad' and 'Age of revolution', which are (not by chance) the two singles  taken from the album, but also 'The sweet spot', 'Gentlemen and players', 'Jiggery pockery'.. to make the long story short, the whole album is well structured.

Opener 'Emergency Contraception Blues' is the albums most interesting track and also the highlight of the record. 'Evening/Morning' is another nice track.

Not every album can be YHF just like not every album by the Beatles was Sgt. Peppers. Why can't a band like Wilco just put out good music and have the critics appreciate that? This disc is full of really good tunes. From beginning to end, it may be their most listener friendly since Being There.

It's basically a record full of folkie songs and rockers with a bunch of dissonant sounds tossed into each one. Wilco is a way more challenging and progressive band musically in the albums since Nels Cline and Mikael Jorgensen joined the band than before them. But because Sky Blue Sky and Wilco (The Album) don't have songs filled with ambient sounds like 'Poor Places' or krautrock blitzkriegs like 'Spiders (Kidsmoke)' doesn't mean they're not as progressive musically. Listen to tunes like 'Impossible Germany' or 'Bull Black Nova' and tell me they're not progressive or Nels Cline freakouts. Plus the last two records were so much tighter thematically than 'Yankee Hotel Foxtrot' or 'A Ghost is Born,' probably because the band has a solid, happy lineup, and Tweedy is more stable mentally and physically than he's been in a long time.

For instance, 'Bull Black Nova' sounds like a b-side from A Ghost Is Born and 'Country Disappeared' wouldn't be a stranger on Sky Blue Sky.

Adam and Joels guitar skills are top notch with this album. They really brought the pain, with creative riffs and amazing harmonies whats not to like? Howards voice is incredible, the guy and really belt it. He could sing anything and I would enjoy it. The bass lines are also great, thanks for delivering those Mike D. I always enjoy his grooving lines and the sick way he plays them on stage. Oh and I can't forget Justin even using a kit as simple as his, he never ceases to create a great beat.

And the singer's voice is SO good, that when singing along - I sound so off key I may as well be singing a lullaby. There isn't a single song in the album I dislike, each one is unique and powerful.... making this the Best Thing I've listened to all year. Yet I think other reviewers are harsh to judge the album on previous releases by the band, just because it's not as good - doesn't make it rubbish, treat it as something new - not an addition to 'as daylight dies'.

The guitars and bass are still clean, but I notice when it changes and not very flattering are the sound of the drums and the voice very different from Howard Jones, is very weak in comparison to their earlier work, also suggest that KSE began emporear, hopefully not the case then.
But the album overall the album is good and still has the drive and melodic style that everyone loves from KSE.

6,"The worst album this great band has ever released? The answer is in the question. There's no doubt how disappointing this album really is especially when comparing it to Utter Greatness like 'The End of Heartache' & 'Alive Or Just Breathing'. The album is not just a failure of Killswitch's standards but commercially too. Ok maybe there's a few good songs in there that are worth singing to but what most people question about this controversial album is the crunching riffs from Adam D & Joel S. Yes there are some great choruses in this album but the verses? Fairly Poor in all honesty & for the lyrics by the great Howard Jones? Another Flaw. KsE are my favourite band but this is certainly an album to forget for all avid Killswitch fans.

And the verdict is, a very solid album. This album proves that they can do anything musically and it will still sound very good.

It retains its listenability long after the initial honeymoon phase is over which is more than can be said for The Bedlam In Goliath, as massive as that album was upon first listen. Octahedron's songs are compelling, bittersweet, and beautiful with the band getting in touch with their more emotional songs.

Highlights are Teflon, Since We've Been Wrong, Desperate Graves, and classic TMV track Cotopaxi",0,0,"Apr  1, 2012"

Unalterable and mostly slow paces filling Octahedron may not match the band's image at first, but nothing more erroneous. Powerful and melodic at the same time, it is a beautiful combination of Cedric's voice, ranging here from the lowest of all albums to time ('Luciforms') to definitely high-pitched ('Cotopaxi'), and strangely simple-layered melodies dragging into listening them over and over.

Everyone reviewing this album calls her a quirky genius, but i find this to be her most mundane album yet. She sounds bored 90% of the time, and she used to use her voice as so much more of an instrument. All her weird vocal affectations (ie: '2.99 Cent Blues' or 'Lounge') are gone. She wouldn't dare do her old stuff now because Sire (her major label master) would never let her. She's doing what she wants, but within the confines of a major label. Especially the old Folding Chair where her voice was so much quirkier and more enthused. Now it's a bland attempt at recreating greatness. I miss the old Regina, and aside from one or two tracks, this is an annoyingly banal release. (EVERYONE needs to listen to her REAL first two albums, 11:11 and Songs.

Begin to Hope was a slight improvement, but still lacked something to sweep me away. Far is different. It can go from dark, moody and gothic (Machine, Laughing With) to bouncy, upbeat, and sunny (The Calculation, Dance Anthem of the 80's) in an instant. It can either rely on the quirky voice'n piano stuff she did mostly on her first two albums (Folding Chair, Eet) or it can veer away from naked acoustic melodies to band-backed numbers (Blue Lips, Man of a Thousand Faces). In other words, this is Regina acting more like herself than she ever has. Her voice and lyrics are still as beautiful as ever, and she sounds very much at home. Overall: BUY THIS WHENEVER YOU GET THE CHANCE! SUPPORT REGINA! Also, anyone who thought this album sucked doesn't know crap about good music.

Great sound, the piano seems more used for this cd but that's okay even great since she's talented at it. The only flaws ate the turns she dies in sings with her voice which sometimes sounds great but mostly sounds distracting and she also gets repetitive but besides that is really perfect.

In short, she has always been this humble and sweet musician who paints masterpieces by doing what comes to mind, and that's why we love her. A 'polished' sound does not detract from that. 'Far' is, in my opinion, better than her previous two albums, and this is coming from someone who will freely admit 'Soviet Kitsch' changed my life. I think it's interesting that music reviewers who listen to 20 sec. snippets of her songs decide that, because of her increasingly accessibility, Regina has somehow lost the edge that made her popular. They would be far off the mark. Talk to any fan of Regina before this album's release, and they'll tell you that if she's changed, it's only been for the better.

Apollo and the Buffalo is essentially a pop song with some obscure lyrics about Greek God's and some girl named Anna playing the guitar, and it's one of the catchiest song's Sunset's ever done. You Go On Ahead is awesome. That's about it. Nightingale features some of the best (and most understandable) lyrics Spencer's ever written and it's a big departure from the rest of the album. Dragon's Lair is, without a doubt, the greatest song Spencer's ever written. This thing is huge. It's fucking epic. And even though it's 10 and a half minutes, it flies by and I wouldn't mind it being longer. The only weak song is Paper Lace (and that's weak by Spencer Krug standards, which is still better than most things out there today) - I preferred the Enemy Mine version. But this one's still good.... The only thing I wish they would have done with this album is make it longer. Maybe add that guitar version of Coming to at Dawn they've been playing on tour.

9,"Well. I never thought I would vote on mc as a user. But I have to say. This album made me realize how amazing Spencer Krug, and more importantly even, Sunset Rubdown is. Before this it was all Spencer, and Spencer is amazing. But this album was the one that, while Spencer still brought it all together, everyone else got to give a bit. 'Silver Moons' is amazing, forget how it ties into the last song. 'Idiot Heart' was my fave song at first easy. And that 'hope you die line' was on par with previous amazing SR lines. But I totally fell in love with 'Apollo...' because of the lyrics and the music. But the thing this album did the most for me, is made me realize just how awesome everything is Spencer Krug has done with Sunset Rubdown.

9,"Just praying this score holds up. This is the record of the year for me so far. I have always loved Krug and, in many ways, this represents his finest moments yet. He has taken the quirkiness displayed on Random Spirit Lover and the more accessible rock elements from his Wolf Parade output and combined them almost perfectly. The only song that just feels out of place is Paper Lace. It has a great second half, but the beginning is awkward and sludgy and it just kind of ruins an otherwise perfect album.

My favorite song, however, is 'Wither'. So many levels of melody and has elements of soft melody and awesome harmonies. I too, think this is their best album since Scenes From a Memory.

It has everything to make you feel the joy of being a DT fan. One of the best albums, if not the best overall, of the new DT era (i.e., since the release of the heavier Train of Thought, 2003).

9,"This is not, on first two listenings, a perfect classic SY album akin to Daydream, Sister, EVOL, Dirty, Goo, or Murray Street. It is however, as good as excellent albums such as Nurse, Washing Machine, Rather Ripped, and A Thousand Leaves, and stronger than Experimental Jet Set Trash and No Star, and far superior to NYC Ghosts and Flowers. It is a meaty representation of many of the band's evolved and codified strengths, with a few welcome nods to their distant past in texture. There are moments that vividly recall EVOL, while at the same time the album represents SY in the present with succinct yet expansive conviction. It is true that there may not be many (or any) new tricks on this release, or left turns, for a band that used to be known for left turns. In some ways, a Sonic Youth album is now as predictable as stronger latter Ramones albums were, or dare I say a good AC/DC disc - we know what we love about the band, we expect it, we want it...so we get it. It isn't formula alone, because there is still so much vitality in the performances (always), and the songwriting (from time to time.) No one does noise guitar with as much beauty as they do. And Steve Shelley is a slamming drummer... I like it more than Rather Ripped actually....quite a bit more. A fine album by a great rock band.",0,0,"Jun 11, 2009"

It's a wonderful work, worthy of buying",0,0,"Sep 16, 2011"
8,"At first listen it was my least favourite Placebo record. Apart from Brian Molko's vocals it just doesn't feel likea Placebo record. It might be the brighter, more positive sound of the record or it might be the strange pop like production. There is definitley a placebo shaped hole in the middle of this album and it just isn't as spikey as other Placebo records. Strangely enough the band re-released the record a year after its initial release in remastered form, a treatment usually reserved for records that are decades old. The remastered version is a marked improvement, with the new mix giving the record a fuller and deeper sound. It has definitely helped me to hear the record in a different light and the more I've listened to it over the last few years the more I like it.  I'm still not sure if I would rate it above any other Placebo record but I have decided it is a very decent record, undeserving of the criticism its received. For those who don't like it  perhaps try the 'redux' (remastered) version. It's definitely a better record. Getting to the songs, they are still different to the traditional Placebo sound being more power chord rock than glam/goth rock. The band obviously tried to go in a different direction with this record and for that should be commended rather than lambasted. There are plenty of excellent tracks on it but perhaps is spread a little too thin at 13 tracks. That said, I can find positives with every track, even 'The Never Ending Why', my least favourite track on the record, has a nice dancy chorus. In fact there are several times throughout the album where I'm reminded of the bands cover of Boney M's Daddy Cool, be that a good or bad thing. The worst thing about the album is that lyrically at times it takes itself a bit too seriously, and also the fact that Trigger Happy Hands was omitted from it and included on a bonus disk on a reissued version of the album.  For the most part it's a very strong album.",0,0,"Sep 13, 2013"

This album doesn't play as well as some of their other albums, namely Busted Stuff, and Before These Crowded Streets; but what it does is both give the listener very listenable material while also challenging them with several different genres and styles. From Spaceman to Baby Blue, it may be the best six song run on an album the band has ever done. I guess the best part about this album is that it seems as though all of these tracks will transfer incredibly well live.

0,"I love it when the die hard DMB fans continue to say 'best album ever' every time they release a new album. Now if we were to go back in time to the 90's, I would agree that every album that came out during that span was the 'best album' (ending its run with BTCS). Lillywhite Sessions was good but of course that material was raw and lacking both lyrically and musically - hence the need for Busted Stuff, which was definitely up to par with the 90's sound and depth the band possessed. But this 'Big Whiskey' album is a load of fluff and mundane mediocrity. This is possibly the worst effort given by Dave when it comes to writing intricate lyrics - instead they come out as repetitive boredom. For example, check out the last track of the album: 'The two of us together...yeah...yeah.' We he feels he needs to repeat that a 100 times throughout the song is beyond me. Someone on here said it best - the rich, wealthy Dave needs to get back to his roots, as does the rest of the band. Sadly the only band member who was tapped into his roots and wanting to get back the sound that made DMB great is deceased. After 5 years of promising new songs heard live like Idea of You and so forth, we get this garbage? I own every DMB album and I could care less to purchase this one.",0,0,"Jul 13, 2009"

However, that has flipped, and now I only like three songs on the album (Lying in the Hands of God, Squirm, and You & Me). Still, I cannot say it is a terrible album, but it certainly continues the downward slide of Dave Matthews Band since Crash, which is unfortunate for such a uniquely talented group.",0,0,"Jan 11, 2014"

This album has kicked back into gear and Adam has certainly improved lyricly. Thumbs up TBS, good to have you back! (though with another different line-up).

So if you want the 'angst' back, just listen til you understand-- Adam was a teen when he made Tell All Your Friends, and wrote and sounded like one. Now that he's an adult, he's going to speak like one, just like any person. Expectations are the worst thing you can have when it comes to a band you like. Each album is unique, and needs to be judged with different criteria. And that's why that Spin review is garbage. He compares them to U2.",0,0,"Jun  8, 2009"

8,"Often considered as the album that killed Taking Back Sunday, is the most underrated album under the band's belt. The previous release, 'Louder Now', was a strong but weak at times effort to follow up on a great album ('Where You Want To Be'). If I could've had it my way, this should've been the album that followed it up. 'New Again' shows sorrow and pain in the largest of things, whether it be God or relationships, and nails it. Tracks like 'New Again', 'Swing', or 'Carpathia' show a deeper side to Lazzara's writing more than 'Louder Now' ever did. The standout track on this album is definitely 'Everything Must Go', building up to a Appleseed Cast-esq post rock epic chorus in spite of divorce. 'New Again' definitely doesn't get a lot of time in the spotlight enough, considering it may be one of the best Taking Back Sunday albums to date.",0,0,"Apr 26, 2013"

Both Horn of Plenty and Yellow House interspersed their 'wow' moments evenly throughout the album, often putting them in the middle of songs that meandered and explored musical space for a few minutes before really opening up. The result was fascinating and consistent. On Veckatimest, they have split their explorations and their explosions into different songs entirely, and it's incredibly frustrating to me. After hearing a Two Weeks or While You Wait for the Others, both of which are pop perfection all the way through, it becomes harder to want Grizzly Bear to meander on a song like Dory (easily the weakest track on here).

Veckatimest will without a doubt be looked back on in years to come as not just a great album, but one that bucked the trends to create something truely special.

6,"If this band comes through my hometown, or even a neighboring city, I'll go the distance to see them, because I bet it will be a killer show and a few dollars well spent for a good night of uptempo rockin' out. But this record is an extremely well-executed re-tread of old indie pop rock territory at best, combining Strokes-inspired American Rock vocals with the uptempo 4/4 lifeless sheen of British indie rock. The British influence is quite clear, and in fact you'll note that reviewers from across the pond are the ones giving this record the chilliest reception, because they've learned the hard way to distrust indie-pop polish as a sign of greatness (or one hopes they have). A few good singles for the dance floor do not earn a 10 (or even an 8). The most redeeming quality of this record is the lyrics, which carry much more pleasing (actually, wonderfully intelligent) nuance than this music usually attempts, good enough, in fact, to push it into the 8s if it weren't for the fact that they're all delivered over basically the same musical vehicle, which incapacitates great lines like 'Do you remember when 21 was young' by drawing attention to the fact that this band is aging and still hasn't figured out a way to put their greatest strength at the forefront. Just a little quietness or a little more swagger, a shift or disruption of the pounding 4 on the floor, a little break from the Strokes-esque removal with which all the lyrics are delivered would push this to greatness. This fairly serious misstep earns Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart a 6 in my book instead of the 7 I want to give out for those lyrics. This record will be fun for a good long while (read: 3-4 months), and then the next thing will come along.

With this album Phoenix takes jangley pop, dance beats and sonic tones and combines them in such a way that it is almost insulting to mention them in the same sentence as The Strokes, who I think are very one demensional.

7,"Since I (mostly) enjoyed Manson's 2007 album  Eat Me, Drink Me I bought The High End of Low on a whim without sampling it beforehand and was not disappointed. While still no where near as good lyrically as Antichrist Superstar The album is mostly enjoyable for the entirety of it's fifteen tracks. Starting off with Devour a track the starts soft and acoustic before building to up to aggressive gold. From there on the listener is treated to richly layered guitars and even the use of strings (a first for a Manson album). Halfway through your hit with an great acoustic number called Running To The Edge Of The World before continuing on. There are a few tracks that are obviously weaker, namely WOW and We're From America. But after listening to the albums high points like like Four Rusted Horses, Wight Spider, and Leave A Scar they're easier to forgive.For those that purchase the deluxe edition your treated to a bonus disc that features acoustic versions of several of the albums better tracks, all of which work exceptionally well. I would imagine that an unplugged tour, while unpopular with most of his fan base, would actually warrant a live cd worth buying.If you used to be a Manson fan but haven't picked up an album since Holy Wood you might want to give this one a try. While different from his earlier releases he seems to have found a new musical direction that actually works for him. The High End of Low is an enjoyable album that has rekindled my interest in Marilyn Manson as an artist and just may do the same for you.",2,2,"Sep 22, 2010"

2,"I can't focus on listening to this album to save my life. Song after song is wasted on obnoxious, unimaginative guitar and Manson's scratchy voice that willingly alternates between whispering and screaming, though rarely leaves the vocal range of maybe 6 half steps. If you listen to the first 20 seconds of a few songs on the album, take, for example, 'Blank and White', 'I Want To Kill You Like They Do In Movies', or 'Leave A Scar', you might think they were pretty catchy. It's a quaint little guitar riff, despite Manson plowing through it with his obstinately monotone voice. But after the first minute, that catchy little guitar riff starts to get pretty damn old, even more so through the rock n' roll song formatting used for every single song (Verse 1, Chorus, Verse 2, Chorus, Bridge, Chorus x2, Abrupt Ending). To put it simply, Manson is devoid of the originality and shock factor he once had. He should have quit while he was ahead.",1,2,"Aug 20, 2009"

10,"Already being underated by critics, but what do critics know? They can't even enjoy anything for what it is without dissecting it to the most irrelevant miniscule detail. This album has a glam rock edge similar to Mechanical Animals without the concept, instead the focus is Mr. Mansons personal demons. It's great and Twiggys return is instantly noticeable when listening to the avant garde sounds weaving throughout tracks on the album. The album cover to me accurately sums up how the music sounds and feels. Very enjoyable and honest album. He stayed true to himself instead of rehashing the past like everybody wants him too.",0,0,"May 26, 2009"
9,"OK, so in my opinion this album is definitely a grower. Bigtime. When I first heard the songs I wasn't sure what to make of them and it seemed like manson was totally washed up and was just whining about his life. But after delving into the songs some more, it's really nothing like that. Sure it's introspective but it doesnt convey hopeless desperation like parts of the last album. Instead it feels more like an optimistic tone, about realizing one's weaknesses and emerging stronger through the experience. This is why I see alot of parallels between this and Antichrist Superstar. I was lucky to have been reading the long hard road out of hell around the time I got this album so it all kinda made sense that way. Anyway, the point is: manson has not lost the subtlety and meanings that made his songs so epic. The album is pretty self-centered, but I think you'll find alot of songs from previous albums are VERY much the same way even if they don't seem like it. (see Kinderfeld) If you just give it a chance you'll find much more meaning than meets the eye, just like with previous manson works. Also, there are some pretty interesting experimental sounds that are really freaky, twiggy coming back did seem to mix things up just enough.",0,0,"Jun 20, 2009"

Such a horrible song, seriously Brian. You deserve to be called Brian on this one. It's just flat out horrible. Somehow, the remix makes it seem like a HAPPY song from the deluxe version. I mean, you've got to be kidding me, right? 'First you try to fuck it, then you try to eat it'? It is possibly the lowlight of your career, and I find it shameful that it is meant to be your 'single'. Anyhow, the rest of the album is absolutely spectacular, which is why I would give it such a high rating. Many critics and public reviewers all over the Internet have been bashing the living hell out of this record because it isn't Grotesque, Mechanical, or Holywood. Manson has moved on from that era, I believe. He has always said that he just reinterprets his world through his music, and I believe that is what he is doing here, and even through 'Eat Me, Drink Me'. They are fantastic pieces, but just not traditional Manson. People should understand that and respect that and enjoy it. For God's sake, it's a new MM record! Be happy for once. Rant over.

This in my opinion is one of Manson's best works. So much emotion was put into this album, and it winded up being an enjoyable one. I feel like it was unjustly criticized.

10,"I'm genuinely baffled by the people who say there's no progression in the songs. 'Alice' starts off with a creeping, slow guitar riff and ends with a wailing horn... How are they the same thing? This is music that requires focus, attention, and an appreciation of where it's come from and what it's trying to do. That can take years to accomplish. I first came to Sunn O))) ten years ago and couldn't stand them. Now I've gone back, having seen them live and buying a sound system that can almost manage the low-end layers, and it all makes sense. It's not pretentious, it's not 'just art' (whatever the hell that means), it's a form of music that asks more of its audience than other styles, and creates atmospheres that most other bands would struggle to begin to understand.
And if you think you could make money by sticking a mic by a washing machine and distorting the effects for 30 minutes, just **** do it and get some money so that you'll hopefully feel less of a need to act like a moron.

10,"Really is deserving of a 10. The fact that Sunn have created an album this beautiful is on its own astonishing, considering the overwhelming darkness of their previous releases. Not that this is an Earth-like reinvention in atmosphere. Opening track 'Agartha' is especially unsettling. But as a whole, there is more to explore here than just darkness and depressive drones. This is an album to lose yourself in, an epic symphony that is feeling more and more like the pinnacle of drone and avant metal. It is easily the best album I've heard this year, and it's been a great year for metal. Maybe it won't hit most people as hard as it hit me, but it should reach more listeners than Sunn's traditional followers. Albums like this don't come along very often, and you'd be doing yourself a disservice if you didn't atleast listen to it once.",1,1,"Jun 28, 2009"
10,"Rudiger and Axel, you are both casualties of misinterpretation. I also doubt that either of you listened to the album properly. I will explain things to you, smugly, to counter your fascinatingly bitter conclusions. This music has nothing to do with virtuosity, with melody, with rhythm, and, believe it or not, with artistic pretension, though I have yet to confirm that latter statement with Stephen O'Mally. Either way, Sunn have made it clear: their music needs to be played LOUD, and that doesn't mean through your laptop speakers. You need to blast that shit, on big speakers, properly. And this takes courage, because their 'music' is actually trying to achieve a desired effect through timbre and vibration. It's music serving as a physical force, not an emotional or intellectual one. And by physical, I mean that you should FEEL the sound pressing against your body. But granted, you do need a pair of balls to experience Monoliths as intended. Your ears will be punished, but the reward lies in the experience of staring directly into the Sunn, even if it blinds you. Do this, THEN rate the album. If you still stand by your statements, without pride as a motivator, I too will stand corrected.",1,1,"Jul 18, 2009"
9,"The people who dismiss this record as a 'joke' are probably the same people who dont 'get' Pollock or Rothko while at art museums because it isnt easily decipherable or full of colorful cherubs. I completely understand this type of music isnt for everyone, but to expect that it SHOULD cater to you is where you've gone astray. If you didnt like drone metal before, why is it a shock that you dont now? Sunn is not a band I listen to often, nor do I think I would really want to. But their works are incredibly powerful when in the proper setting and frame of mind (drugs are not necessary..this IS the drug). And to echo the others here, you need to listen to it at maximum volume on a VERY GOOD stereo system. My appreciation for these guys went up ten-fold when I caught their live show. In that setting, the sound truly does shake your inner soul and leave you falling backwards into a infinite black abyss. The ironic thing is, Monoliths and Dimensions is easily their most accessible work to date, especially Alice which is one of the most darkly beautiful tracks I've heard this year.",1,1,"Aug 13, 2009"

5,"I'll jump in with the first vote that lies directly in the middle. Admittedly, since I have roommates whom I respect, listening to this album at full volume in my apartment was never an option. I even tried to convince them them to pop in the CD on the living room stereo & crank it. Still no, so I opted for headphones. Let me run off on an explanatory tangent for a few lines. We are all metalheads. We listen to Sabbath, Maiden, Meshuggah & even Dimmu Borgir turned up all the way. While we may be spoiled on speed, we're still dedicated to a future of metal-induced deafness. That being said, I still believe this album is extremely overrated. Visceral thought it may be, it's still a bunch of dudes droning on heavily detuned instruments with no discernible attempt at musicality. Maybe that's the point. But I'm still not convinced. On an artistic level, I have to hand it to them: they have balls, which is why this is interpreted as metal. However, I agree with Lance R. This album is best experienced very loud. Loud and possibly under the influence of lots of LSD. Since I left the blotter with my friend Ricky, I have to evaluate this album in a (somewhat) sober state. I can't see why anyone could assign a droning, largely dissonant collection of noise on the very periphery of the mainstream a 10, unless you're reacting those giving this album a zero. Perhaps it's a sonic evolution for the band, but I can't see myself particularly interested in their previous works. Monoliths & Dimensions is plenty. Conversely, I can't bring myself to rate this album lowly; mostly due to its provocative avant-garde appeal.",0,1,"Aug  6, 2009"
2,"Listening through this album is painful. The pretension on this album borders on parody. There is no demonstrable musical or compositional talent.

It's not art, there's no musicianship, I'm only giving it 1/10 because the ablum art is cool. The only reasons I can find for liking this album is if... 1. You're one of those loser metal types that think you're so dark and messed up that chanting about satan is cool. 2.

With that being said, this music is about exploring realms of human emotion and musical sound that have not been explored very deep.

This is art - and art doesn't care if you like it. The artists in this band take their work seriously, and have obviously made an impression on people. Again, you are not required to like art.

Using christian gospel chiors in tandem with dronign guitars I thought would never work, but it did! It was eerie, lazily simple, but at the same inadvertently sophisticated. This song came in at 4 stars. After Big Church, there came Hunting and Gathering (Cydonia). This song was the first time I had ever heard Sunn O))) put an ounce of creativity into. They usually just play the same guitar notes over and over with loud volumes. But this one had the grinding guitar rhythm that was layered perfectly with low voiced vocals. In the final 2 or 3 minutes of this ten minute epic, it had the bell from Big Church and the quick muttering. This is something I found inventive. That and the trombones made this song a great opener for your Halloween 2009 mix. 4 stars out of five. The final song, and certainly the best song was Alice. The simple guitar rhythm provided a spooky, eerie texture to the song, and then it faded into an incredible jazz-ensemble outtro. It was incredible. It was mesmerizing. It was, in my opinion, one of the best songs ever made. 5 stars out of five. The mean for 1, 4, 4, 5 is 3.5, making it tied with OK Computer for best album ever on my list.

I agree this album is too long, the material is not strong enough to warrant 17 tracks. Albums of similar length (The Beekeeper, Scarlet's Walk) worked because the songs were much more interesting musically and flowed better as an album. It just doesn't happen here, after a few songs I found my mind wondering to other things, I could hear it, but I wasn't listening. I like the first two tracks, but overall, it's a yawn.

I have always loved how she continuously evolves from record to record but with 'Abnormally' I feel that she has just thrown together 20 years worth of worthless 'B' sides and called it a night. I love you Tori, but even you can't be as proud of this as you were of your work of old.",1,1,"Jul 23, 2009"

9,"Exceptional Album : Beautiful Songs and unforgettable lyrics: I have to remind Give , Welcome to England , Flavor , Curtain Call , Maybe California , That Guy , Starling , Mary Jane , Ophelia , Abnormally Attracted to Sin and Lady in Blue. I could see in these songs the power and the strenght of an incredible women who knows how capture our hearts. If I had been Tori Amos I would have deleted some tracks from the trackist like Police Me , Strong Black Vine and Fire to Your Plain . For the rest is Ok .",0,1,"Jun  1, 2009"
9,"I didn't like it the first time I listen to it. But when I tried to listen to it again I finally got it. Its one of her best albums in years. I didn't enjoy an album of hers like this since From The Choirgirl Hotel. Great stuff indeed!",0,1,"Oct 17, 2009"
10,"The more i listen to this album the more i like it... thats the good thing about Tori, she creates songs 4 a lifetime not for 2 weeks or 2 months. I still love and listen Little earthquakes, the Beekepper and all of her albums as if they came out 4 sale yesterday... AATS is a rare and dark masterpiece...hard at first but beautiful and captivating then, just like its creator.",0,1,"May 29, 2009"
9,"Tori Amos is intensely generous with her music, including the fact that her albums are over 70 minutes. Why is it that critics consider this a detriment? One man's filler is another man's grandeur; at least give her credit for adding to fans' value palette. Critics: Cut the 25 minutes you don't like and give it another review.",0,1,"Jun  9, 2009"
10,"Yes, this album is long, but even the few songs that would've been B-sides have a certain charm, and I'm glad they are on the disc. I have been a fan for 15 years, and this is her most impressive effort in quite a while. Lush electronics and vocals, all beautifully wrapped up in trademark Tori weirdness. This album exceeded all my expectations!",0,1,"May 20, 2009"
9,"A very interesting album. I like it. I'll note that as with all of Tori's works in this decade on first listen it seems a little long and in need of a bit of editing. However, I have found in the past that much of her work that seemed easily disposable at first will come back around to you later on and pleasantly surprise in some manner. So buy it now, edit it down for current listening, but save the all the tracks and revisit the trimmings in a year or two (or three) later on.",0,1,"May 21, 2009"

Key tracks are: Give, Flavor, Welcome to England, Curtain Call, Maybe California, and That Guy.",0,1,"May 22, 2009"
9,"From a personal point of view: I have been listening to Tori since her first album. It is so refreshing that she is willing to grow and change. With her talent she could bend things and make a record seling album if she wanted to but instead she continues to do what she loves and stays honest about it. Much respect. Notice this album isn't a high output, venting outlet but it is as if she is in the same room with you, You get Tori Amos....if you don't like it ..don't buy it. She has already proved herself.",0,1,"Sep  5, 2009"
9,"For Tori Amos fans, don't be scared by critics. If you recall, Boys for Pele, which became a tour de force for Tori, was not initially well received. This album is full of beautiful music, and is her best effort since 2002. It actually serves as a better follow-up to To Venus and Back. It contains songs which have immediate hooks, and others which require a long simmer so characteristic of her work (title track, Fast Horse). Welcome back, Tori!",0,1,"May 19, 2009"

9,"I consider myself to be one of Tori's biggest fans - and this album instantly became one of my favorites. Yes, it is a little long, but I don't understand why that is still a shock to people. Tori has stated many times that she is more than happy to put songs that don't necessarily fit in with the material in order to give her fans a more expansive view into her vision for the record. If you don't like the song, hit the skip button - it is there for a reason. As for the content on the album, some of the strongest material she has written in years is found here. Songs like Starling and Flavor show Tori's ability to send shivers (quite literally) down the spine while Maybe California and Ophelia remind us how powerful a piano can actually be. Tori hasn't been this affecting in nearly a decade. Sin, in this case, is quite delectable.",0,1,"Aug 26, 2009"
7,"A lot of folk are commenting on the number of tracks. Amos has been doing this for years. Scarlet's walk and Boys for Pele both 18 track Juggernauts were both masterpieces.; The trouble here is the quality of the songs and Amos' isistence that she fits each composition into a rigid conceptual framework. Frankly I'm not bothered if this record is a comment on the hypocrisy of our moral custodians and the oppressive power of sin, I just want to be moved and entertained, and about a dozen songs on this LP qualify on both counts. The rest should have been edited out. Get this woman a producer.",0,0,"May 20, 2009"

8,"Great album, it especially comes alive on a pair of great headphones. This album has had many listens since its release. I know there have been quite a few comments on how their are too many songs or that the album runs too long and while I can see that point of view, I honestly don't know what songs I would trash; after many listens, they have all grown on me. As far as the length, while it longer that most albums released by most othe, I find it to be well sequenced and has a great pace. Doesn't go by too fast but most importantly, it doesn't drag. One of the most surprising things about this album (at least I found it surprising) is that Strong Black Vine featured someone other than Tori on keyboards. Tori's longtime string arranger John Phillip Shenale is credited with B3 Organ and synths whereas Tori is credited with vocals (and what a vocal performance it is).",0,0,"Jun  2, 2009"
8,"It is a little lengthy. It isn't her best album ever. It is however a gorgeous and haunting offering from my favorite artist. She is always challenging us to listen and I'm sick of critics throwing her material away before properly listening to it. It is easier to give the latest popular swill a good rating because it is engineered to be accessible. Tori has never been about what is accessible. I implore everyone to take the time to break it down before throwing it away. Some tracks (Not Dying Today, 500 Miles, Starling) are a little tedious at first but are just as interesting as the rest. My favorites are: Give, Strong Black Vine, Flavor, Maybe California, Abnormally Attracted to Sin, Ophelia, and Lady in Blue. She is perhaps one of the greatest artists of the age because of her refusal to compromise. She is always herself.",0,0,"Jun  7, 2009"

Abnormally Attracted to Sin is by far my favorite transformation she has shared with her audience. AAtS is not instant gratification, you must research it's origins and listen for musical signals in each Sin based song. It's a beautiful collection of electric gothic inspired tunes surely that will stand the test of time. Once you get it, you won't let go. Start with the title track, examine the subtext, concentrate on the layers of sounds, from there work your way out..... There's a key hole on the back of the cd for a reason. Mmm",0,0,"Oct 10, 2011"

This is only her second mediocre record.",0,0,"Apr 19, 2014"

9,"An excellent Tori Amos album, as always. 'Maybe California', 'Welcome to England' and the title track are my personal favourites, with the first one being, in my opinion, one of her best ballads ever. Also, 'Lady in Blue' is a terrific closer. As for the large number of tracks, I would, too, be happier if she moved some of them to B-sides or the Deluxe Edition, for example 'Police Me', 'Strong Black Vine', 'Not Dying Today' and '500 Miles'. I don't consider them bad, they are just most likely to be skipped over.",0,0,"Apr  6, 2013"

8,"21st Century Breakdown is highly underrated. If it had not been American Idiot's follow up album it would have been recieved in a much better light. The album is not as good as American Idiot but it has a plethora of great songs that go from wonderfully composed pieces of music to extremely simple and catchy songs.",1,1,"Sep 27, 2012"
7,"Is not a punk album, but it's still catchy, 21st Century Breakdown would probably be the laziest album of the band, arenas will be a bit disappointed, but some tracks will return the powerful crowd as Bullet In a Bible or as the breakout Dookie",1,1,"May  1, 2016"
9,"I must say, in terms of sound quality and consistency, that this is one of the finest rock albums ever produced, as well as another Green Day masterpiece on par with American Idiot.
The sonic tone, with the ever-familiar aftertaste of ardent punk, manages a successful splice with stadium rock that allows for both fun, catchy songs ('Horseshoes and Handgrenades', 'Know Your Enemy'), as well as more grandiose tunes that soar to heroic heights ('21 Guns', 'Last of the American Girls') and tug on the heartstrings of the listener, as well as a few tracks that bring out the best of both worlds ('East Jesus Nowhere', '21st Century Breakdown'). The band has never sounded as good as they have on this album, not even on American Idiot in which they were still experimenting with their shift into rock opera territory and still had an overwhelming punk flavor. For some reason I skipped over this album and went straight to the Uno/Dos/Tre trilogy after finishing American Idiot, and the clean, clipped sound of the guitar on those albums just didn't do it for me. But where those albums failed, Breakdown exponentially succeeds as a perfect blend of sugar, spice, and everything nice.
The themes and story of the album have received some criticism, and while I agree that the storyline isn't as focused as Idiot's, it doesn't need to be--rather, it functions more like a collection of short stories than a novel. Christian and Gloria function as the primary characters, but rather than having their tales told in a linear manner, the album's scattershot presentation of them is perfectly reflective of the album's main theme--the collapse of American (and truly, world) culture during the modern age. External forces such as religion and politics are attacked with force and vigor alongside internal ones such as a growing sense of insecurity and alienation, the feeling that the lives of individuals don't carry as much weight as they did even twenty years ago.
The juxtaposition between Christian and Gloria is one of the most interesting things the album has going for it, in my opinion--Christian, struggling to be good for Gloria while still battling with his own demons, and Gloria, who is placed upon a pedestal as an example to and a light for the masses scrambling in the dark for answers and purpose--and the characters are highly self-reflective of frontman Billie Joe Armstrong and his wife Adrienne. Armstrong's battles with substance abuse are well-known in the music community, while Adrienne is his rock, the visual representation of the ideals which he believes are the best humanity has to offer (self-admittedly, 'Last of the American Girls' was written with Adrienne in mind), and he dramatizes and romanticizes the struggles they endure every day in order to create a lasting, rallying battle cry for the people of the US, and the world.
In closing, 21st Century Breakdown is quite deserving of its Grammy Award for Best Rock Album, as it succeeds as a fun, thoughtful yet easily accessible album that offers something for rockers everywhere, on top of spreading a pretty poignant message about the dissolution of society in our day and age. 9/10",1,1,"Aug  5, 2016"

Much like the Epic American Idiot, 21st Century Breakdown is an album in the style of an rock opera, so expect this album to become a musical in the near future.

After spending a considerable amount of time between making new music, I expected the band to return with something fresh. And if '21st Century Breakdown' had been released as a companion piece to their previous record in 2005, I could probably appreciate this.

Musically to my ears this album sounds like a mix of Warning, American Idiot and Insomniac with a sprinkle of Dookie, although that doesn't mean they are rehashing their previous sounds because they've built upon them and made them fresh again, they even try new things that would otherwise be considered not Green Day ... like Billie Joe singing falsetto on some of the tracks.

The title track 21st century is a brilliant capture of 21st century life and songs like before the lobotomy and Viva la Gloria are also master pieces. there is only one BAD song on this album and that is Know your Enemy which sounds like it should have been on American idiot but worse.

I got the album the day it came out and within hearing the first 6 songs i was blown away. Green Day has not slipped up or slowed down at all for this album. From the song's like Murder City and American Eulogy that reminded me of the Dookie days to the Ballads like 21 Guns and Last Night On Earth have shown me that the band is not afraid to grow up some and change there style while still remaing punk.

American Idiot showed its intentions to be big and its execution to be even more immaculate, though where it faultered was when Billie Joe attempted to provide answers using meticulous epics such as Homecoming. In this album it sees Armstrong looking back over the carnage that the Dubbya reign brought over America and this time dosn't provide any answers. A nod to the White Houses latest occupant that he is the one who must sort out the devastation inflicted on America. This album may not give the sucker punch of a wake up call that was American Idiot but it provides us with yet another fantasic document of the times and a vivid narrative that starts to unfold before your very eyes (or should i say ears). There is no doubt about it anymore, America may still have a huge mountain to climb in the process of its restoration but in terms of Armstrong and co. they have already reached the summit.",0,0,"May 16, 2009"

It's dull and lacks anything special. Only two songs really stood out for me '21st century breakdown' and 'American Eulogy' but the only songs just seem lazy and lack ambition.

Now 21st Century Breakdown is nowhere close to being as good as American Idiot was, but it tries to be and does a pretty good job in the process. Green Day continues the Rock Opera in post-Bush America. Here the two protagonists (Christian and Gloria) are trying to survive as working class heros all the time trying to be corrupted by the government and religion. Billie joe and Co. have 18 solid songs here and the album is full of energy from beginning to end. There are moments of classic punk Green Day ('Christian's Inferno', 'Murder City' and 'Horseshoes and Hand Grenades') and the mature side of the band ('21st Century Breakdown', '21 Guns' and 'See The Light') Billie joe turns in his best love song in his whole career of writing ('Last Night on Earth'). 'Peacemaker' and 'Viva La Gloria (Little Girl)'has the band experimenting with middle eastern while Billie Joe shows of his new talent by playing the piano on tracks such as 'Restless Heart Syndrome' and 'Viva La Gloria'. Some of the songs are repetitive in their structure with a slow beginning and a strong finish, but that is the albums only flaw. Compared with American Idiot this album won't stand the test of time like the latter will, but taken by itself this album is just a pure Punk Rock album by one of the best bands of our time.",0,0,"Feb 22, 2011"
6,"Every Green Day album gets bashed and praised - for me Insomniac was the best so far, but sadly, Breakdown, as perfectly good for the job it is, simply never tops anything before it. I've seen most of the album performed live, and it works  well. When I saw older tracks live, they all kicked ass. I wanted to like this record, and I do, but it is truly unimpressive in light of Green Day's discography. The first (two) track(s) is/are perfectly good, and then my recollection of the track list, after listening to this album tens of times, is Know Your Enemy, which is sort of irritating, and out of place at this point in the album, iViva La Gloria!, which is a good, well orchestrated song, then mostly whiny, unremarkable drivel until the last act of the album, with self-titled first track 'Horseshoes and Handgrenades', which is an epic example of modern rock. East Jesus Nowhere, The Static Age, and 21 Guns all deserve commendation too. But, at the end of the day, this seems to be a album taped together in random order between a great opening, and a great, if re-used, ending. To look at this album in it's acts, the album's division's, just pay for act three on a legal download site, and forget about the rest - it's not worth your time.

6,"I loved American Idiot. I loved it because it was complex while being raw and thematically amazing. Green Day was really good with political songs back then. That said, I feel like this album is a bit directionless. Critics praised the political involvement of Green Day. So Green Day thought to themselves ''Hey lets make an album that's even more critical'' but really you can feel it's forced and vague at best. Where American Idiot made a point, 21st Century Breakdown tries to be melodramatic but fails.Musically, this album has some good songs. Some great ones even, like iViva la Gloria! and ?Viva la Gloria? But I do think that some of the complexity of Green Day's longer songs has been taken away and replaced with generic 4 chord music. Also, it's a bit overproduced. I liked it when there wasn't triple bass and guitar everywhere, but there were some bits where you could actually hear the guitar being fragile and unsure.Where before I would have defended Green Day against people calling their music ''cheap'' and ''too simple''/''simplistic'', here it's completely justified.Green Day, don't try to live up to American Idiot by trying too hard making everything the same as that.I heard some of the newer stuff they wrote lately and performed live and honestly it's a good development again.

Musically, the songs are ridiculous over the top epics that sound like Muse if they ever did a hard rock song; the album also contains its fair share of ballads which aren't impressive but still great songs. Tre Cool hasn't really evolved his drumming skills, and Mike Dirnt is still a competent bassist, Billie Joe sticks to the punk formula of a few chords but also implements the use of piano on the record whilst ranting his way through.

Taken on its own merits though 21st Century Breakdown is still a great album. It's another rock opera, the arena sound comes back and there are more songs. This is one of those cases though were bigger doesn't necessarily means better. The story is weak and not easy to follow and the arena sound isn't as fun in a structured format.

Space Savior would not drive so furiously if it did not follow the ethereal Pangaea and Happenstance, while the album closer, Operetta, pulls forth all that came before into a crescendo of slowly swirling choruses. Here, Kilbey's voice, more so than in previous outings, demands attention, not because he desperately need to be heard and seen like an angst ridden youth or an American Idol contestant, but because he has something to say and the ability to say in his natural voice.

This one is more nuanced and as previously said the guitar from Toshi has as much a part as the bass from Jared or the drums from Coady.

Them, I gave Primary Colors a listen because of the rave reviews it was getting and wow. The post-punk influences tickle my pickle, Faris' is more reserve and controlled as are the guitars that still have distortion in them but instead the atmosphere ins't chaos, it's more controlled and more matured. I take these guys seriously now, and I can go as far to say that I'm a fan of this band, and will completely disregard the first album. Highlights of this album are: 'Who Can Say' 'Scarlet Feilds' 'Do You Remember' 'Sea Within a Sea' & 'I Can Only Think of You' those are the above average songs in this album that really make this album one of the best albums in the last five years.

There is nothing in this world as loathsome as try-hards with scant ability hoping to get lucky, and this is where we find Isis. Never managing to top their dbut with the same trite idea and same conventions and structure appearing again and again.

Out of the songs that strive to be raging rock like Colour, Can You Give It triumphs. With thumping, fuzzy bass, and screaming guitars this song dances between sweet soft verses and rolling choruses. No Kind Words is by far the darkest track The Maccabees have ever done. You can almost feel emptiness in the track with such bare-bones instrumentation until the song descends into dual, crazed guitar lines. The ending track Bag of Bones pt. B may be the greatest song the Maccs have ever done. Stylistically it is nothing like the rest of the tracks on the album, but it accomplishes what a closing song on an album should do.

Still 'Bible Black' and 'Follow the Tears' should be on a future 'best of' Sabbath/Heaven & Hell....they will be on my own next Cd-R with the greatest Metal songs to enjoy when I drive the car or go nuts at home (poor neighbours).;-)",0,0,"May  9, 2009"

Not an instant classic, but compared to 99% of the other music you could listen to this is absolutely amazing stuff. It's impossible to compare to other NOFX albums at this point since it's still new to me, but my first impression is very positive. Of course it sounds a lot like their older stuff -- but it's the sound that they created themselves! If they drastically changed their style (a la Green Day) it would be a huge disappointment to me, and I've been a fan since the mid-90's.",0,0,"Jul  9, 2009"
8,"While not as classic as Heavy Petting Zoo or S & M Airlines, it's still has a few gems. Fat Mike has matured a bit in his lyrical writings. 'My Orphan Years' is atypical for a NOFX song, with strong emotions of loss of family to death. But do not fret, there are nods to Indigo Girls inspired indie rock twins Tegan & Sarah in 'Creeping Out Sarah.' 'Blasphemy (the Victimless Crime)' is classic sounding NOFX. I highly recomend this album for any NOFXist. It still rings of the Cali punk style, which may be underground, but still pounds its chest strong.",0,0,"Jun  3, 2009"
9,"Perhaps a bit rushed, or perhaps there is just nothing left to sing about, the latest offering from this punk rock elite outfit is neither their best or worst record to date. Unfortunately this is more of a straight up rock record than their forays into assorted roots of music and their brash brand of humor is fairly absent from this record with the exception of their single 'Creeping Out Sara' which is a short and very humorous piece about creeping out Sara (or was it Tegan?) from the canadian folk duo Tegan & Sara once night backstage at a show. If you were to introduce someone to NOFX's music, this would probably be more towards the bottom of the list of what they should listen to first, but like most NOFX records, it's not a certain charm to it and they really can't write a bad record (or even a bad song for that matter). Their last record was a stellar effort, but this one doesn't seem to match. Perhaps age has caught up with them or they've settled a bit on their haunces when it comes to the songwriting process. All in all, any fan of NOFX will enjoy this record, but it will only temporary hold them over until the next effort and if you're a first time listener, please give their earlier work a spin and then consider coming back.",0,0,"Jun 11, 2009"

Like I said before, it took me a few listens to really get into the songs on DD/LY, because their style has changed a bit. On the other hand I think only SFA could have produced an album like this one. pop elements mixed with grunchy guitar riffs, electronic beats and instruments and disco-esque rythyms mixed into a whole.

10,"Adam Hull really shows his maturity with M.O.'s followup to 'I'm Like a Virgin Losing a Child.'  I would normally hesitate to use the term, but I can't think of a more appropriate word than masterpiece.  It is an infrequent occurrence for anyone in the music industry, especially today, to develop a thematic album, both musically and lyrically, but Andy Hull and his talented band mates have assembled just such a work with 'You Mean Everything to Nothing.'
Despite being only 21 at the start of recording, Hull managed to assemble a list of one meaningful song after the last.  When most kids his age are happy making efforts in music, or lyrics, Hull shows the acumen of song writing like that of a veteran twice his age.  Not only is he able to show a range of musical moods, but he weaves in an remarkable self-awareness and ability to express his feeling in song.
But this has all been done before.  We've seen this, in rare cases.  Somehow M.O. weaves the themes of humbling self-doubt and an expression of intense love for his wife, throughout this offering.  I don't know how anyone can listen to the song, 'Everything to Nothing,' and not feel that this isn't one of the great love songs.
The musical theme starts at the beginning of 'The Only One' and is picked up on many of the tracks. I haven't heard a commitment to theme like this on any album, since Pink Floyd's 'The Wall.'  I  won't loop through the album track for track.  I feel that this album should be taken in in its entirety. Like 'The Wall' I find it strangely troubling to hear one of the tracks independent of the rest.
No matter the power of the songwriting, it is only as strong as the band.  Lucky for Hull, he has surrounded himself with talent.  Hull is a great guitarist in his own right, but Robert McDowell does a great job working the leads; allowing Hull to stretch his voice.  But, I see the band's instrumental signature sound coming from keyboardist Chris Freeman who injects an extremely heavy sound to an otherwise melodic band.
Keep in mind that I'm a 48 year old man.  I usually have little interest in anything that a 21 year old has to say or play, but I see this band as a force majeure of modern music.  I hope that as these kids grow and develop (hard to consider after hearing this album) we are going to hear even better music, more meaningful lyrics.

Frankly, it's not enough to adequately hold one's interest over the 40+ minutes of radio-friendly bullet points. Track 'In One Ear' reeks with a teenager-like attitude that is honestly stifling at best. On occasion, they dip into the confessional when not mired in self-righteousness, such as in 'Back Against the Wall,' but the immaturity of their writing and lack of inventiveness ultimately makes the message hard to believe.

Nick Bockrath who currently plays lead guitar replaced original band member Lincoln Parish in 2013.

Cage the Elephant has a unique style that separates them from the rest. There vocal stylings and chord progression reminisce that of The Rolling Stones and The Red hot chili Peppers. On the record they combine hip hop and punk with different flashes of blues and funk. There songs Free Love and James Brown are examples of the concept in use.

8,"Whoever said that this is pop marketed as indie rock is retarded. Metric has been around for a while now and are here to stay. The album is slick which is not the same as commercialized.

9,"Great album. 'Blindness' kills me, 'Gimme Sympathy' and 'Sick Muse' are infectious. There are just a couple tracks I don't love, and I probably just haven't given them enough listens yet. I'm saving the 10 for the next album, because based on this outing I truly think they are getting even better. If you read a review where some misinformed soul cries 'sellout', understand that this album is the antithesis of that. Shun the major labels, handpick your team from a network grown through years of travel sharing your music, and wood-shedding in your own studio with creative control to produce it is not selling out.

Silversun didnt try to make an over the top album, they made a dark, mysterious, powerful album with Brian Aubert's (vocalist/lead guitarist) high voltage and innovative guitar playing and the rest of band playing just as hard.

The guitar sounds so different and I've never heard a guitar sound the way it does until I heard this album. It's pretty neat. But anyways, Swoon is a pretty good album. Every song is catchy and the rock and roll single 'Panic Switch' is one of the best rock songs I've ever heard. Brian Aubert has a great voice and it sorta sounds like Billy Corgan.

9,"Swoon is the album that made me love SSPU. From the emotional 'Growing Old Is Getting Old' to the upbeat, distortion and effects-heavy 'Panic Switch', this album is fantastic. My only gripe is that I felt 'Surrounded' was a somewhat average song in an almost perfect record, which brought down the score a bit for me. This is still one of my favorite albums and I would recommend this record to anyone and everyone.",0,0,"May 25, 2012"
10,"The Puckups, well, pick up a lot of flack for sounding like Gish-y Pumpkins, but this album has an atmosphere- a density- that calls to mind a Kevin Shields production. Still, solid songwriting and the ability to manipulate mood really shine through the dense sonic fog. 'The Royal We' is our favorite track, but 'Panic Switch' gets the most attention, perhaps for its urgent delivery. Overall, Swoon tastefully serves up a well-balanced tracklist, leaving the listener full after 51 minutes of flavor. Producer Dave Cooley seems to be the secret ingredient as evidenced by the lack of flavor in SSP's Cooley-free third album.

She was aiming for some kind of haunting 80s-esque effect but forgot to write engaging music. Sure, it's an okay album to chill out to. But she is way too talented to settle for a chill out record.

But, it has the presence of folk, psychedelic sounds that made this her best effort. Her intelligence was capable of making a 'alter-ego' and stick to it until the end of the songs. The songwriting of hers is stylized and classy, but at some songs, like 'Siren Song' it calls for less eloquencye. Then again, her best material!",0,0,"Sep 25, 2012"

The result is a sumptuous, slick album whose first seven tracks are a study in confidence, musical pluck, and the avant-garde, and whose final four are just icing on the cake.

Mixed in with a lot of 'familiar' melodies is a couple rewarding moments but it feels more like I've been on this path before. Jetstream is a mess of a song and Compulsion is so Blondie-esque that it's distracting. Most of the albumn lacks the percussion pop of older Doves and mellows out in areas instead of cranking it up. 10:03 and Outsiders inject some life in a Moody Blues stream of songs that don't go fast enough but at least don't drag.

9,"As a complete album with an arc of songs, it is Mould's most consistently solid record this decade. It doesn't necessarily have the front loaded highs of Body of Song, and is not as eclectic as District Line. Overall though, it may be better than both of those previous albums (certainly stronger than DL). The title track, the Breach, Argos, Spiraling Down, and most of all Wasted World are the highlights. WW is one of the best songs he's written and produced in years, and within it, he finally unleashes the sort of unhinged guitar solo he hasn't played since Beaster's 'Tilted', 16 years ago! Argos is fun - SugarDu meets Pansy Division. The only eh songs are City Lights and Lifetime, the rest are fine tunes. He's been touting the record as Workbook revisited, but it really is not that; maybe just in spirit and in how he went about writing the songs. But they don't sound at all like Workbook. The album is streamlined, subtle, sturdy and compelling. Dog and Pony has stronger songs at times, Body had more hooks and sugarguitars, and FUEL had more melodic drive and velocity, but as a cohesive statement, Life and Times just might be the best Bob Mould release since Beaster.",0,0,"Apr  8, 2009"

1,"Lame. A TREMENDOUS dissapointment. Right now I wish that they would have tried doing something new (not new to them... but, revolutionary). I remember a couple years back they said they were 'traveling the world' trying to find a 'new sound'.. so I waited...... and they come out with this crap! It sounds like many things, I even heard some songs with Madonna tunes mixed in... WTF! (Not sure if they realized the were doing it..) In all honesty I don't HATE it. But it is not good; not just by YYY standards, but by any MUSIC loving person's standards. It's Blitz has no soul, no fun. For the first time in my life I am NOT going to their concert because I've seen them on youtube performing and Karen O has become a standing statue of boredom... I can't blame her, however. HOW CAN ANYONE HAVE FUN OR BEGIN TO FEEL ANYTHING WITH SUCH RUN OF THE MILL MUSIC AND HORRIBLE LYRICS!!! (With the 'thank God!' exception of 2, maybe 3 songs) WHO IS POSTING REVIEWS?! NINE YEAR OLD GIRLS?!!! JUST BECAUSE IT'S YOUR FAVORITE BAND, DOESN'T MEAN IT'S GOOD. I would be rating it a 5 but since everyone thinks that these ratings are just a game and think 'I was going to rate them an 8 or 7, but I want them to have a higher average rating' (RETARDS! Can't even tell the truth of their opinions) Now I rate them a 1. So that they could go down to what they deserve to be. Ughhhh... I hope that their next album is the best album they've ever made. I don't want to see a great band fall just because they want success or to 'do something new'. In that case DO SOMETHING GOOD!",0,3,"Jun 10, 2009"

There are a couple of good songs, 'Head Will Roll' 'Runaway'... but nothing tremendous to make up for track that can only be described by one word. 'blah'. There's no soul in this album. I will have to wait until Karen O decides to focus on releasing an album as Native Korean Rock. This looks promising, they will probably produce a classic album based on what I've heard of them. It's blitz is easily disposable. It's not horrible. But it sure isn't good.",0,0,"Mar 31, 2009"

The songs are all pretty great with even the not fantastic still being a great exercise in songwriting and production. For a band that has always scaled down to produce and explore other sounds is always a treat. I highly recommend this for anyone that was a fan, and am expecting great things from this tour.

9,"With across the board **** to ***** (out of *****) ratings and grades above 8.0 (out of 10), Writer's Block -- the third studio album by Swedish indie-pop sensations Peter Bjorn and John -- is considered the band's magnum opus. Only a truly all-around amazing album could top it. Living Thing offers more varied sound and matches up no question to its predecessor (Seaside Rock, the band's mixed-reviewed 2008 instrumental release, doesn't count). 'The Feeling' is a mellow electro-pop, drum-and-clap offering that contains some elements of a Capella. 'It Don't Move Me' sounds like Tears for Fear meets the Arctic Monkeys. The synth works well with Peter Moren's never-fail vocals. 'Just the Past' has a steady drum and hints of Afropop, making it draw an instant comparison to anything that Vampire Weekend has ever produced. The song finishes with a nice little repetitive 'na-la-la-na-la-la-la-na...' chorus. 'Nothing to Worry About' has been the most hyped track pre-release. It deserves praise simply for the kid-chanting chorus and it's lyrical comparison to 'Amsterdam,' coincidentally the fourth track off of Writer's Block (compare 'put a little money in this type of thing' to 'put a little money into traveling'). 'Losing My Mind' is kind of random considering its pure post-punk revival in the vein of Interpol and Editors, as opposed to the more indie-pop prior four tracks. I can definitely see this as a potentially astonishing live song to perform. The title track 'Living Thing' is impressive and is more symptomatic of PB+J's prior work, yet also very experimental and even a tidbit Animal Collective-y. 'I Want You' is great! Put on headphones for the full effect. The guitar is particularly catchy, the vocals entrancing, and the feedback bass line just fitting (for lack of a better word). Best track on the album? I would argue so. 'Hey, shut the fuck up boy, you are starting to piss me off. Take your hands off of that girl, you've already had enough.' Yup, those are the opening lines of 'Lay It Down.' Innovative, huh? Snap your fingers and sing along to the aforementioned lines. You'll have fun. I tried it and I certainly did. I'm going to go ahead and say the next song 'Stay This Way' is like a really good Jens Lekman tune. It's a story, some snapping, and a slow guitar riff. It makes Peter Moren happy. It makes him not want to go back or move on. A little disco goes down in 'Blue Period Picasso,' but don't let that label get to you. It's just a part of Moren's beating heart. Seriously, though, sometimes I wonder how the hell this band comes up with its lyrics and general song structure. It's beauty. You'll know what I am talking about. '4 out of 5,' is it a reference to the first sentence of this review? Doubt that, but it could be a little foresight of what Rolling Stone would give this album. I like the '60s feel to this song. 'Last Night' is the perfect speed for an album closer. A fast song just wouldn't make sense. I kind of expected a crazy experimental build-up towards the end, but you can't always get what you want. And that's perfectly fine. Looking at this album as a whole, I can't find too many faults. There are no 'Objects of My Affection' or 'Young Folks,' but there are many tracks that have the same kind of awesomeness factor -- a reason why PB+J is a mainstay in my Top 10 favorite bands of all-time.",1,1,"Sep  3, 2009"
6,"Their album fillers are more difficult to understand when PB&J are the only one's who dwell in their abstract world.

9,"Maybe I'm a little crazy but this is by far my favorite PB & J release to date. Yes, even above the overly praised and hyped Writer's Block (Honestly after hearing Young Folks about 50 times unwillingly I have never played the track again). However, I find that I can come back to Living Thing time and time again because each song has an indelible pop hook and catchy riff, chorus structure or tongue in cheek lyric to smile at. Continuing with the honesty I did not like this album at first. I didn't get it, but after giving it a few more listens I caught onto more of the beats and found myself singing along with almost every track. This album is by all means a grower, and the growers are the best. This album is rewarding with each subsequent listening and truly makes me hopeful for the future releases from this trio.",0,0,"Feb  2, 2010"
8,"An unexpected and curious follow-up to 2006's 'Writer's Block', this CD is notable to listeners of that album for its 'stripped' and 'desolate' approach to songs. Often starting with sparse vocals or a few beats, few songs make a huge melodic impact in the first 10-20 seconds of themselves. With most being slow burners, taking a minute or so to becoming well-defined, impatient listeners will be put off this release. This goes for a lot of time-pressed music critics, who probably only had a single spin of this disc before passing their premature and negative judgment. While there is no 'Amsterdam' or 'Young Folks' here, there is the sufficiently catchy 'Just the Past' and 'Nothing to Worry About' to lure in the listener. Further listening reveals powerful, memorable and high quality melodies beyond the bleak production and soundscapes. Living Thing builds from a beginning of strange clicks to an emotive chorus of 'you don't have to look me in the eye', forming one of the album's highlights. 'Blue Period Picasso' offers a similar structure, starting with a curious 'a capella', flowing intro a melody involving some Eno like sound bleeps and effects which prove memorable. The song itself shows its beauty with its vocal echoing through 'a world famous art thief'. Many of the songs are mournful and depressing. Particularly the desolate album closer 'Last Night', 'Stay this Way', which is tinged with sadness in melody and lyrical content, and 'It Don't Move Me'. The negative points of this CD are, apart from 'Lay it Down' for me, its pure strengths. The CD music contains little variation in style throughout with stripped musicianship, bleak production and depressing vocals. PB&J have clearly evolved their artistic in a style where so many artists either fail or don't bother. This demonstrates great credibility for PB&J in my view. Their sound on 'Living Thing' both evokes 'Writer's Block', while taking giant steps in progressing in their sound. This pleasurable combination of the familiar and the unknown is what makes great music. I'm sure many people and critics will be let down by this. They probably hoped PB&J would continue to drift more mainstream after 'Young Folks', and this certainly isn't it. However it's progressive and likely to make an impact on your life more than most of its contemporaries.",0,0,"Jul  9, 2009"

I'm not sure why we must fault them for this on 'A New Tide.' Once you see them in concert, it becomes crystal clear that they are a terrific, powerful rock 'n roll band.

Dance 4 Me is fun and funky yet $ takes it up one from there. The song 77 Beverly Place is a wonderful instrumental track. Dreamer is not Jimi Hendrix reborn as a lot of listeners will no doubt say. It is, simply Prince still living. It is amazing. The guitar work on Lotusflow3r makes it a classic for guitar enthusiast. This is an album that you simply have to have.

10,"Lotusflow3r (10/10) Lotusflow3r is a completely SICK album. Why? Because it shows Prince the complete musician and what a joy it is to listen to a complete artist. MPLSound is a good album and one that I enjoy, but it only shows one side of his musical genius and is a nostalgic throwback to his early 'sound' when he was just becoming the musician he is today. Lotusflow3r details Prince the complete musician. There's isn't one weak song on this album. 4ever, my least favorite, suffers from weak lyrics but is a joy to listen to. As a whole, these twelve songs span rock (Boom, Wall of Berlin, Dreamer), 60's style jazz (Love Like Jazz), Pet Sounds style instrumentals (77 Beverly Park), straight up Prince funk (Feel Better, $) and there's even a cover song (and a great one at that, Crimson And Clover) for good measure. At first I wanted the entire album to be Prince's 'rock' statement and was disappointed that it went in a different, more complete direction. But now I see it for what it is... a diverse masterpiece of music from the master. Prince isn't afraid to hit you in the face with some stunning rock guitar and then fake you out with a song that turns into a beautiful instrumental that older, more refined listeners will love. He can funk it up, but he can also sound like Hendrix while spreading a message without being too preachy. I didn't think Prince could top the musicianship of The Rainbow Children, but he's done it with a more diverse masterpiece.

6,"Probably the most disappointing of all the releases I've heard by Doherty. In 'Palace of Bone' Doherty sings in a mostly deep voice which I think suits him brilliantly but this is abandoned at the chorus and the rest of the album. 'I am the Rain' (except for the awful harmonising at the end which I find really grating), 'Sheepskin Tearaway' and the single are the highlights to me with 'Arcady' being pleasant enough but songs like 'Sweet by and by' are plain offensive to my ears. I used to like the acoustic demo of 'New love grows on trees' but it's had all the spark taken out of it in the ratyher boing version on display here. Again none of the other songs make me want to hit repeat. I listened to his demos back in '03 and they had far more charm (admittedly the ones I liked best were covers- 'Jean', Huckelberry Grove' but the others have lost their charm as he re-records them on his releases. Also it's pretty clear that at times his rudimentary guitar playing hinders some of the songs and his choruses are 'tacked on' So sorry for rambling: overall disappointed, only Place of Bone sticking in my head for the moment",1,1,"Apr  1, 2009"
10,"First and foremost, I must say this: before hearing this album I only knew of Pete via the tabloids, blogs, etc. The only image I had of Pete was as the severely drug-addicted ex-boyfriend of Kate Moss. How my view has changed. This album is work of art, poetry and melody that, to me, clearly establishes Pete as a massive talent to be reckoned with. Forget about the sex and drugs part for a minute because we know he's lived that image up quite well. It's the rock n' roll part that proves Pete Doherty is worth the hype. Pete is a troubled soul, but one that has immense talent simmering inside and waiting to explode. That is the feeling I get when I listen to this album. I don't hear someone who writes radio pop and sings with a perfect voice (although perfect nowadays just means 'autotuned'). Instead, I hear a modern day bard who has been to hell and back and has some stories to tell. I no longer view Pete Doherty as the severely drug-addicted ex-boyfriend of Kate Moss. My new view: a severely troubled artist who I hope will get his head on straight.",1,1,"Apr 10, 2009"

9,"I will just start by saying that those who say that this 'Isn't a decemberists album' are completely and utterly wrong... besides the fact that it's on the cover. The decemberists have been known to try new sounds, riffs, melodies and other means to match Colin Meloy's ambitons. The Hazards of Love is as close to a 'Rock Opera' as we're are going to get now-a-days, and for that, i humbly applaude Colin for taking a risk and creating a fresh experience in these modern times. Now, i have to say that i am a HUGE decemberists fan, so i may be a bit biased in my review. However, being a fan, i can say that this album is not for everyone. It's very complex, emotionally driven, and one can't get singles from it... easily... The album is, However, very cohesive and succeeds in building and releasing in moments to create a full fledged story element, climax and all. If you are going to listen to this album, do it in one sitting... or on the car ride to and from work. It takes about an hour. I won't guarantee that all will like it, but if you've ever liked the decemberists and understand their lore and style...then enjoy. Listen to 'The Tain' if you want a similar experience by the same band... consider it the 'short film' to the 'feature length.'",1,1,"Mar 26, 2009"

9,"I have not heard The Decemberists' other albums. I bought this one from having heard the Rake's soliloquy on NPR just before the album released. The story, presentation, flavor, music, and gestalt of this album is really wonderful. This album is not for someone who desires a 'hip three-minute ditty,' to quote John Popper. Instead, The Hazards of Love asks a lot of its listeners, in that an appreciation of the content is discovered slowly though an accumulation of context. The first listen was casual, and provided very few 'hook' experiences. I wasn't sure I liked The Decemberists. The second listen yielded a bit more fruit, as the awareness of a cohesive story arc took off. The third listen helped me notice thematic threads attributable to characters I was only beginning to reckon. The many listens since then have continually sharpened my awareness and appreciation of this work, and I am now fully open to seeing what else The Decemberists have waiting for me in their catalog. I may like their other works better or worse, but, regardless, on its own merits The Hazards of Love is exceptional, and the professional reviewers awarding it 30s and 40s should be wary of their job qualifications.",0,0,"Apr 18, 2009"
7,"I feel like I would be closer to giving this a 7.5 or 7.7 because of the simple fact that their pretension has entered a new level. The Decemberists have been delightfully over the top in how they portray their story telling elements and indie/folk compositions, but with this it moves into the territory of bad heavy guitar Guitar Hero II fodder rather than a new course of credible music to the Decemberists previous ideas. The concepts are intact, but where's the presentation headed? Hopefully, they'll bring back some of the old, with a modified new in the future. Not to say that this is bad that they need to scrap this as a failure. It's a decent album, but give me Picaresque, give me Her Majesty, give me Crane Wife and The Tain before you give me this after-dinner mint.",0,0,"Apr  5, 2009"

They an authentically origianal band making music the way it should always be. The album is top notch. There are absolutely no loose ends, and everything works to a tee.

9,"Another great album by Mastodon. Of all the bands in today's music scene, very few can get you as excited for a new album as Mastodon can. This one is a very ambitious, epic release, and they have pulled it off masterfully. 'Divinations' is the closest thing on the album to a straght-on rocker in the style of 'The Wolf is Loose' or 'Blood and Thunder'. Most of the other tracks are more mellow and atmospheric, suggesting influences from all over the musical spectrum. Mastodon's songwriting really shines on this album - they are without a doubt the modern masters of the concept album. Although this one is great, I slightly prefer the sound of their previous 2 albums, which had a good balance between the screams and the clean vocals (this album has almost entirely clean vocals). Anyway, I give them props for trying something new and expanding their sound, although I would prefer if their next release was a little more 'metal'.",0,0,"Mar 31, 2009"

This record itself trades low end punch for beautiful melodies and freak outs, everything well executed and very well recorded and mixed.

I understand that any artist that has been doing music for so long, might want to try something new. This might be new for him, but we've heard this type of pop music so many times before. Timbaland was obviously not inspired on this. He might have done it simply to get more visibility, and of course more money, but I taught his success with You Know My Name would've been enough. On the cover, you see him breaking his guitar, which says all about the album because you won't hear any of it. I sure hope he buys himself a new one, so that we can forget this mess.

1,"Wow I'm shocked and disappointed. Chris Cornell making an R&B groove/dance orientated album is a great idea in concept. I can think of nothing better than dancing to his voice. But in execution this failed in ways I can not comprehend. How could two seasoned musicians deliver this, I'm thinking they must be tripping over their overblown egos. Timbaland went way overboard and drowned out Cornell. Cornell reverted to cliche R&B lyrics and concepts. Do we really want to hear Cornell singing about rubbing up against girls ala Nelly? Blech! There was all the potential in the world to do something great here - but wow what a misstep. I'm pissed I spent my hard earned money on this.

Now, this album def. ain't perfect - what music is. But it's a decent effort - in places, very good indeed - and it doesn't deserve this vicious bullshit from people who can't hear past the fact that it's not all guitar, bass, drums and screaming. I used to love my rock, but these people give the whole genre a bad name. Hey, that's not a bad idea for a song *sings* 'You give rock a bad name...'....and I sure as hell don't mean Cornell by that.

This is novel in a time where so many albums just seem like a bunch of songs slapped together.

4,"I think the main problem people are having with this album is the blending of 2 worlds. On one side of the board we have Timberland representing the most commercial aspects of hip hop supplying the sounds and on the other side of the spectrum we have the wild, hypnotic vocals of Chris Cornell representing the grunge/rock side. Before even listening to the album those 2 worlds blending together automatically creates a sort of bias attitude toward the album. Typically if you are a fan of AudioSlave and Soundgarden you really aren't spending much time listening to Timberland and Magoo records and vice versa bringing back the old Rock vs Hip Hop war. Typically and unfortunately in most cases when these 2 sides combine it fails miserably like when Metallica tried to work with Swizz beats of Ruff Ryder fame. But we can't forget of course the times it worked. And when it worked, it really worked like when Aerosmith made their legendary connection with Run DMC or even the underlooked collaboration of Public Enemy and Anthrax. Those artists found a happy medium and made it work. I doubt if Aerosmith and Run DMC decided to do a full album together each track on there would have created the same magic each time around. What you would end up with is a mediocre album with 2 or 3 memorable tracks and a lot of filler. And sadly enough that is what happened here. Oneof the biggest problems I have had with this album is that it is laid out primarily as a hip hop album rather than a rap/rock collaboration. The song structures are laid out entirely like a typical hip hop track from intro to outro, even the repetive chorus/hook layout used on rap albums. This effort gives it a feeling that timberland made a ton of beats, put Chris in the booth and said sing. No meeting of the minds and joint effort. Ladies in gentlemen what we have is Timberland Presents SCREAM...ft. Chris Cornell. No rock Rock/Rap infusion. Do I hate this album? No, I actually enjoy it being that I am a fan of both Timberland and Chris Cornell. Chris Cornell is one of my favorite singers and Timberland is a producer that I respect and enjoy thanks to his a lot of his original efforts that helped him stand apart from other producers like the neptunes. But going back to the negative...unfortunately the production on this album sounds as if he created 2-3 decent efforts that shows sides of his genius and the rest were beats other artists rejected and were sitting in a crate waiting for the right time to pop up. I honestly would have been happier with Timberland giving Chris some of his best worked used by other artists and letting Chris put his spin over them. Imagine Chris Cornells vocal format from Like a Stone over Timberlands Cry Me a River beat. But i'd rather hear Chris over a Timberland throwaway any day than over a Neptunes track or Lil' John bs. If Chris really wanted to blend the best of both worlds he should have searched for a difference producer than Timberland who's realm is Commericial pop hop and RnB. If Chris decides to do this again...please seek out Rick Rubin. At least he married the two genres together well in the past with his work with the beastie boys and in most recent efforts '99 Problems' by Jay Z. At least his productions is very rock influenced to begin with. If you enjoy Timberland and Chris Cornell then you'll get some enjoyment out of the album. It has some entertaining moments. Listen to it, then once its played to the end put it aside. Trust me...this is an album that you won't have any trouble forgetting.",0,0,"Mar 18, 2009"
1,"I have all Cornell music has done since 1984. He's said some times he felt frustated because he never had the recognisement of the public. He's been after 'success' since he stopped drinking and married with a model. Now he has what he was aiming for. He's happy, has recognisement from the music industry, but he's lost his loyal fan base and has changed them for a bunch of people that never listened to Badmotorfinger when it came out. That said, I still admire him and I'll always love him for the music he's made. I wouldn't be the same without those Soundgarden songs. Chris, take care. And please, stay away from Timbaland.

Can this really be the same man who gave us Audioslave, Soundgarden and Temple of the Dog? Not to mention his exceptional solo effort Euphoria Morning? I don't have a problem with Chris trying to move more into pop but this just sounds like he recorded his usual rock album then stripped out all the instrumentals and let Timbaland (of all people! Why, Chris why??) put dance music where it used to be! I don't think I have ever been so disappointed with an album in my life.

10,"Chris' latest album is truly refreshing and different. While I'll admit it did catch me off guard a few times the vocal power he has in expressing various forms of emotion in his songs was too much for me not to succumb to. The tracks that make up this album are quite good and worthy of listening to all in one sitting. Songs such as Long Gone and Enemy expresses the wide vocal range Chris can take on his songs. One can easily find themselves lost in a plethora of memories, thoughts, and emotions while listening to his lastest album. While some may say Chris took a musical 180 with the overall sound of this album, no one can deny that greatness is always just that, great. Regardless of the rhythms used as a medium to carry his vocals Chris Cornell will always come out on top. This album is only his latest effort to once again prove to the masses that like his previous solo efforts (Euphoria Morning and Carry On) that sometimes what's least expected or totally different is just what we want and just what we need.",0,0,"Mar 19, 2009"

4,"Whereas his previous solo album is still getting better with every listen, this one has the opposite effect. After two or three spins of Scream I liked most of the cuts.

Cornell's biggest mistake was trying to go for big ballads ('Long Gone,' 'Scream') on what should essentially be a light-hearted dance record filled with more straight-up catchy pop tunes like 'Ground Zero.'

7,"Scream, though a bit deceptive in title due to the tame nature of this album, is a shockingly good album considering the background information. For one thing, the idea of dance-pop producer, Timbaland, and grunge legend, Chris Cornell, teaming up for a whole album of songs just seems like a terrible idea. In addition, the album takes after Timbaland much more than it does Chris Cornell, and when the opening of 'Part of Me' started, I will admit I cringed a little. However, as a fan of Chris Cornell, I was just too interested in what would happen with the pairing, and I am glad I gave this album a chance. Despite the heavy electronic/dance melodies, the natural emotion of Cornell's voice is able to shine through (in fact, Cornell makes a very convincing soul singer on several of the tracks) and make this a pleasant listen throughout. Of course, there are plenty weak moments like 'Get Up', 'Other Side of Town', and 'Take Me Alive' and the rest of the album is truly not album of the year quality, songs like 'Scream', 'Part of Me', 'Time', and 'Ground Zero' more than make up for it. If you like Cornell enough, or if you are a fan of electronic R&B/Pop, you might find this album well worth you time and money.",0,0,"Dec 30, 2013"

In his last ditch effort, he recruited Timbaland to make him over as a hip-hop/rock artist. He knew it was either that or a Soundgarden reunion. Unfortunately, it's safe to say that he does not know how to do a proper solo album. The album seems decent, but there's nothing you want to listen to over and over again.

I Do Not Hook Up, co-written by Katy Perry, is a wonderful addition to the album and an anthem for all girls.

A brilliant vocal range, her lovely soprano voice, and some typically decent pop songs make this album, in my opinion, her best to date. Included are her original pop songs (such as 'My Life Would Suck Without You', the U.K number 1) some easy listening ('I Want You', being a kind of 8-bit background music with some lovely, calm-ish vocals to make up a nice pop track) some punk rock (appropriately titled 'Whyyawannabringmedown. One of my favourites, as Kelly's voice clearly fits well with this genre. also, the song is just great) and some slower, more Kelly-style break up tracks like 'All I Ever Wanted' and 'Don't Let Me Stop You'). This album offers a wide range of pop and pop-rock to satisfy any mainstream rock lover. The idol singer still has her amazingly huge voice, and she is definitely the most talented woman in pop today. Katy Perry who??

8,"'All I Ever Wanted' is a return to form for Kelly Clarkson. It's a fun, catchy, and energetic record. This is the album she should have recorded after 'Breakaway', instead of the mediocre 'My December'. But all is forgiven, and Kelly sounds terrific. There is a lot of potential hits on here.",0,0,"Mar 16, 2009"

8,"This is a good album. Lots of catchy melodies and the songs grow on ya. Love Dan's voice. I might prefer Plague Park just because of that album's first 3 songs and 'sing captain,' but this is really solid stuff. Fun too.",0,0,"Mar 11, 2009"

9,"Very good pop-punk album. A blend of their previous work, it ranges from earlier energetic tracks to more melodic Coming Home type songs. It also has strong hardcore influences with chugging guitar break downs and gang chants.",0,0,"Mar 15, 2009"

3,"Cursive has been on a gradual decline since their fourth album The Ugly Organ. Kashir has become more obnoxious with his sexual issues and less vulnerable which has eliminated the endearing quality of the lyrics. Ultimately, especially for any long time fan, this album is boring - like a friend who only calls to talk about the same issues over and over again. We get it Tim - you have a love/hate relationship with sex, suburbia, and religion. You can't live with them and can't live without them. We heard that loud and clear six years ago and your message has been getting repetitious. Oh, and the music sucks too.",0,0,"Mar 13, 2009"

6,"Have to agree with Tom P. I applaude Stith for going out on a limb and for the interesting and unorthodox way in which he composes and arranges the songs. But seriously, this stuff is way too dark and freaky for me; not a good freaky like Animal Collective, but like a bad trip...now why would I want to experience that again?!",0,0,"Apr 17, 2009"

10,"Wonderfully dense. David Stith's vocals, musicianship and musical vision make this an compelling listen, an album to be explored and absorbed. For a point of reference I'd put him somewhere between Sufjan and Grizzly Bear.",0,0,"Mar 29, 2009"

10,"Her fourth album starts out with one of the best songs she's ever written, 'Generosity,' with its subtly complex melody curling up inside your ears. 'The World is Falling' has a distant and eerie humming that radiates softly below is cool exterior. It's a wonderful effect. Simpler songs like 'Gone are the Days' and 'While We Have the Sun' are gentle numbers that, while don't match up in scope to others (ie: the immense 'Forest'), they are emotionally just as great. 'Shells' has excellent instrumentation that is perhaps even more captivating than the vocals of the track, though the melody she sings is enchanting and gracefully stunning. All this is grand, but the real highlight of the album is third track, 'Education.' Mirah sings about the 'education' she obtained from being with someone that she finally realized she wasn't happy being with. The lyrics are brief but ultimately relatable and touching, and her prsitine voice is staggering. (a)spera is a wonder of an album, and probably Mirah's best since Advisory Committee.",0,0,"Mar 15, 2009"
10,"This is one of those rare albums that can change your life.  I have had this album for over three years and every time I listen to it I find something new.  It is the only album I own that never gets old.  Some have called it pretentious.  I find it very poetic.  The below lyric from the song Shampoo is something you would read in the best contemporary poetry of our time.  Combine that with some of the most infectious music imaginable and you start to understand the power of this album:
yellow is the color of my true love's crossbow, yellow is the color of the sun
and black is the color of, a strangled rainbow
that's the color of my loss.
I am only sorry that Perkins has virtually disappeared from touring and music and I hope that he returns with more.",0,0,"Nov 24, 2012"
9,"Arbouretum has that old sound without sounding old fashioned. The music is loud and elegant. It gets better with every listen. 'Another hiding place' and 'False spring' are really addictive. For fans of last psych sixties and early seventies rock and also for indie fans loooking for a harder sound and warm at the same time. No one band sounds like this nowadays. The singer, Dave Heuman has something very few singers has: soul.",0,0,"Apr  1, 2009"
