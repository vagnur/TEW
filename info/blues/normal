8,"Blues or Desperation brings both Joe's distinctive interpretation of the blues as the addition of modern influences on this kind of music. In his gentle and compelling guitar work as in his powerful and passionate bluesrock he shows to be among the best guitarists of his time. Technically he's getting better to live in the raw emotion of the blues in his singing and he manages with the female vocal trio to bring his music in the lyrics to life. His collaboration with several important names in the music industry pushes the album to pretty rhythmic sounds and melodic keys. With the album he maintains the high quality of Different Shades of Blue and understands with his sincerity and desperation to raise the blues to great heights. 8.2/10

9,"Another edit of Blues of Desperation was released for download in July, 2016. 12 tracks are unique to this version in that Mountain Climbing is replaced by the feel-good energy of Mountain Time. The track doen't fit the typical Blues definition but really works as evidenced by JB's fan reaction. Other differences include Drive becoming track 12, and the addition of The River, Bridge to Better Days, One of These Days, Driving Towards the Daylight, Slow Train and Different Shades of Blue. Missing in this version are No Good Place for the Lonely, The Valley Runs Low, You Left Me With Nothin' But the Bill and the Blues, distant Lonesome Train, How Deep This River Runs,  Livin' Easy and What I've Known For a Very Long Time. The July release features 12 songs instead of 11. Great music. Not pure Blues. But just fine with me.",0,0,"Jul 25, 2016"

7,"As a long time Neil Young fan and being quite used to his 'experimental' side, I went into this album being fully prepared to hate it. Instead, I was grabbed from the first song and wasn't disappointed with the rest of the album. His vocals work surprisingly well with the orchestration and choir, probably due to the fact that all he had to do was sit there and sing. It won't go down as his best but it is very worthwhile hearing.",0,0,"Nov  8, 2014"
8,"Tempus fugit
As time goes by, so John Hiatt is feeling older. As it seems in many songs he wrote for this album, he speaks of time, age, suffering, good and bad, God and Devil, tough losses, broken love, etc. In most of them he uses his lower tone, and sings in a slow mood. It could be painful with music on a country mood, but the rhythm here is as smooth as it can be.
I prefer this latest release from the previous ones, Mystic Pinball (2012), Dirty Jeans & Mudslide hymns (2011), The open road (2010) and Same old man (2008). In all of these, there were three or four really songs in every of them, but as much others which were forgettable. Here, like in  Master of disaster (2005), there is no song that could make an enormous hit on the charts, if anybody cares about this anymore, but the quality of all the album is at a higher level in general.
And I really love when Hiatt is showing us his tongue-in-cheek humour, like in Old people here, his most funniest song since Back on the corner nine years ago.
This artist still has a lot to give us. We should enjoy his skills while hes still alive. If youre sticking to the lyrics, he seems close to the end. But the melodies are still great. And its rather good.",1,1,"Jul 21, 2014"

8,"This album is interesting, and I always enjoy listening to it. The album clings to the tenets of early Delta jazz (my favorite) and hosts several great songs.  Laurie shines on the piano and guitar, but tends to fall short when he chooses to sing, especially during his duets. His co-singers however (Gaby Moreno, Taj Mahal, and Jean McClain) are singularly amazing. I can always groove to most of the album, but some songs (I'm looking at you, 'Didn't it Rain' and 'Careless Love') bring the album to a grinding halt and seem like a chore to listen through. The backing band 'makes' the feel for the album, and ultimately there are far more good songs than bad.

Like a good wine, Buddy has gained further distinction and integrity with age, and like a good cheese, he's gotten even funkier too. This man is on fire.",0,0,"Nov  2, 2013"

6,"There are a lot of ups and downs to this album.  On the positive side the instrumentation for the most part is very smooth, organic  creates a nice atmosphere, further shown in Morrison's very distinct voice  vocal delivery we've all grown to love.  The melodies for some tracks can really hook you in  the lyrics remain inspired for the most part, especially on tracks centered around social commentary like End of the Rainbow, If In Money We Trust  Educating Archie.  But there's also straightforward classic pop songs like Open the Door to Your Heart  Retreat and View that work just as well.  But unfortunately there's two BIG problems with Born to Sing: No Plan B, and that's the song structures  lengths.  A lot of songs here are very predictable, repetitive and do much more than their fair share of meandering just for the sake of throwing in another verse that doesn't add much or a 3-minute instrumental break that could've been a couple minutes shorter.  This especially gets problematic with the 8-minute songs Going Town to Monte Carlo  If In Money We Trust, which both start out great but I end up bored after 4-5 minutes have passed, if not sooner.  The latter is affected the hardest, with a haunting atmosphere  great basslines wearing off in appeal by the heavily drawn out length, which isn't helped by the repetitive lyrics.  Basically, if you cut out every time a verse was repeated here, the song would be 5 minutes shorter.  Unfortunately what could've been a great song is reduced to a repetitive mess.  Similar problems happen in the title track Born to Sing.  And moving on to more specific gripes, Close Enough for Jazz was shaping up to great little instrumental in the first half but is unfortunately interrupted in the second half by completely unnecessary verses that only bog down the song.  Other songs like Mystic of the East  Pagan Heart just don't go anywhere, and the place they're at can't hold my attention for their entire 5+ minute durations.  Morrison just seems too content with an idea to want to develop it any further, and I think those decisions are what ultimately lead to Born to Sing's main flaws.  No song here should've been over 5 minutes.  Still, his all-around songwriting skills, whether instrumentally, melodically or lyrically, still shine through.  Tracks like Open the Door to Your Heart, Retreat and View, End of the Rainbow, If In Money We Trust  Educating Archie are probably gonna go down as Morrison discography staples for me.

10,"I am already a fan ... but this is my favorite DTB album yet! This band is incredible to see live. They are incredibly diverse musically, playing everything from Delta blues, R&B, gospel, jazz fusion, Latin, soul, Pakistani qawwali ... have I forgotten anything? ... and continually reinvent the songs in they already play. The band is tight musically, and play off each other well in the extended jams and improvisations they are known for. The CD's they have released have been just as diverse. (Until now, Joyful Noise and Live at the Georgia Theatre have been my favorites.) In my opinion, Already Free is tighter, more polished, and more refined, than anything the band has done to date. (Significantly, this is the first album they have recorded in the new home studio at their leisure.) It has a throwback feel, down to the sound of an LP on a turntable leading into the title track. I read one review that described Already Free as a tribute to American music and its roots, and I'm inclined to think he's right. Right from the start, I loved the Bob Dylan remake 'Down in the Flood', the gospel grooves of 'Sweet Inspiration', the tamboura leading into the upbeat jam 'I Know', and 'Down Don't Bother Me' (a bluesy favorite of mine from live DTB shows). The more I listen to this CD, however, the more I love the whole thing. It is a rich, textured, subtle album, and a great platform for Derek's incredible guitarwork. Derek's slide guitar has a signature, clear, piercing sound that I originally thought was muted in this album. After listening to the CD a little, however, I realized that I was totally wrong. At times, Derek does sound more polished than usual, but always as a prelude to another awe-inspiring solo. Qawwali music is famous for starting simply and building to a high energy 'in order to induce hypnotic states' (Wikipedia) among the musicians and the audience. That is one of the trademarks of DTB live shows that did translate to this album. Down Don't Bother Me is a perfect example (as is Down in the Flood). Down Don't Bother Me starts out much more polished than the versions I know (e.g., listen to the 2005 Gothic Theatre show in Englewood CO), but it ends with the sort of blistering slide guitar solo that made me fall in love with DTB in the first place. I could go on about how great the bass lines are in Sweet Inspiration, Mike Mattison's soulful voice, the usual outstanding professional sound of the band, or the welcome collaborations with Doyle Bramhall and Susan Tedeschi (Derek's wife). In the end, I'll just repeat that this is my favorite DTB album. You can't go wrong with this one. Buy it!",0,0,"Jan 29, 2009"

9,"well, i had to choose between this and waits new alice . havent heard alice yet but based on one front to back listen, it's gonna have to be real good to beat this. waits voice is for me a little to eccentric at times. so i dig this collaboration, cuz as a songwriter he is a national treasure. only gave it a 9 instead of 10 only because i've only had a chance for one listen, but my first impression is bring on vol. 2!!!!!!!",0,0,"Jul 10, 2002"

9,"If I could give it a 9.5 I would. This album embodies the best of John Hammond and Tom Waits. The only reason I'm not giving it a 10 is because I'm holding out hope that they get together to produce another album again.",0,0,"Sep 17, 2002"
9,"Just finished listening to Wicked Grin for the first time, and I have to say it is a very solid album from start to finish. Pretty much every song was a joy to hear, although there was one track towards  the middle that seemed like it started out a bit off, but even that was a minor hiccup.",0,0,"Jan 31, 2012"

3,"Bill Frisell is a very talented musician ! 1/3 of the music on this album is great ! However, the other 2/3 of the music is too noncommital. Its atmospheric music. No one takes a solo. I would expect more from him. So, I must give it a 3 which is 1/3 of 10.",0,0,"Feb 12, 2005"

9,"Of late I've missed the edgy tension and moody atmospherics that Frisell did so well on 'Where in the World?'; albums like 'Nashville' and 'Good Dog Happy Man', while enjoyable, have a tendency to get a little too mellow. 'Blues Dream' is a perfect mix of Frisell's gentler side and his more raucous, dissonant sounds. I love it.",0,0,"Dec 13, 2001"
