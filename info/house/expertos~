Mixmag,70,"Ibifornia comes with enough funk and cool from guest vocalist Cat Power that it could be the spiritual sequel to the Tom Tom Club's debut album, plus all the faux exotica, busy soundscapes, and chugging basslines suggest the Swiss duo Yello.","Dec  2, 2016"
Pitchfork,60,"The title envisages a blend of Ibiza and California: dancefloor funky pop merges into balmy, sunshine-soaked grooves, although at times the band seem to be feeling the effects of that long gap.","Dec  2, 2016"

Uncut,80,"This particular release has all the textures, tinkles and poise the listener craves from Moss, while often arming them with some pretty hefty, distorted kicks and bass.","Nov 25, 2016"
Pitchfork,80,"Bullish and forceful, The Discos of Imhotep is also a work of considerable intricacy and mystery. Jamal Moss aims high and rarely overreaches, making the album not only ambitious, but a welcome blast of modern house that would live up any club night.","Nov 25, 2016"

Record Collector,80,"Sweaty and ecstatic, elevated and pure, The Discos of Imhotep weaves quite the spell. This might be the most accessible Hieroglyphic Being album to date, but Jamal Moss remains out there on his own.","Nov 25, 2016"
Dusted Magazine,80,"This is techno music that fires the mind and soothes the soul; intricate, micro-tuned productions that work on a guttural level; electronic music that soars by aural intelligence rather than lumpen sonic trickery. In the end, you may not be healed by The Discos of Imhotep but youll certainly be uplifted.","Nov 25, 2016"
The Wire,80,"Where previous releases under the moniker have explored the grittier, DIY side of house, here Moss leans towards the lush, psychedelic end of the spectrum, and delivers a kaleidoscopic sonic journey that commands you to keep going back.","Nov 25, 2016"

The Skinny,78,"Many of the tracks on Hangin' At The Beach, much like Pink's low-key classic 'Life In LA,' grapple with the paradox of feeling lonely and alienated in paradise.

Exclaim,80,"DJ-Kicks is essentially a peak-time mix of house and techno that would be devastating if played at any club, standing still and not cracking a smile would be basically impossible.

Mixmag,68,"DJ-Kicks isn't the best mix Jackmaster's ever done, largely because his taste in new house and techno is less convincing than what's in his record collection at home. There are, however, flashes of brilliance that confirm his status as one of the most skilful and thrilling DJs working today.","Nov 11, 2016"

XLR8r,80,"This mischievous ethos has rarely been better displayed than on this often uneasy listening set from Berlin-based, old-school activist DJs Graef and Astro who, after name-making solo careers, came together last year to form their Money $ex imprint as a platform for their woozy marriages of obscure vinyl sensibility and startling aural foraging.","Nov 11, 2016"

Pitchfork,80,"These are their beloved records, guzzled up, internalized, and regurgitated in new unrecognizable forms; music of the past as perceived by modern minds; an even balance between tight live instrumentation and charming studio nous.

AllMusic,80,"A fun, unpredictable album that is sure to confuse some listeners, but it fits right at home with the nonconformist ethos of Ninja Tune.","Nov 11, 2016"

Record Collector,70,"Built around the usual sluggish grammar of instrumental hiphop, the tracks seems at times to collapse in on themselves, swollen with lugubrious 1970s jazz funk keyboards, strategically aimless organ vamps and miscellaneous concrete samples. [Jun 2016, p.60]","Nov 11, 2016"

Q Magazine,80,"Elasticity's 78-minute running time can be daunting and exhausting, but A Sagittariun's abundance of creativity and positive energy is admirable, making the album a rewarding experience.","Sep 16, 2016"

AllMusic,68,"Principe del Norte across as genial, charmingly rumpled, and totally unflappable.","Jul  8, 2016"
PopMatters,60,"A subsequent stretch of pleasant but generic cosmic disco coasts on the listeners sangria-fuelled goodwill. But the urgency of the final two tracks suits Thomas, as pace brings them into focus, and clouds of minor chords send the sunbathers scurrying for cover.","Jul  8, 2016"
Magnet,60,"Much of Principe's second half finds him repackaging the first half with plodding disco beats that make the initially exciting melodies seem boring the second (and third, and fourth) time around.","Jul  8, 2016"

Spin,85,"It would be wrong to describe Moodymann's DJ-Kicks set as a feel-good mix--it's much more than that, brimming with the highs and lows that real life can offer--but it is a joy to listen to, and that in itself is plenty.","May 27, 2016"
Pitchfork,84,"With his first officially licensed mix CD, for the 51st entry in the DJ-Kicks series, one might expect a set of dusty disco and deep house, but Dixon confounds expectations throughout, detouring at peak moments, going left where he might build momentum, all of it leading to luminous results.","May 27, 2016"
The Guardian,82,"It may have taken him a long time to release a mix in this way, but the quality of DJ-Kicks makes it worth the wait. At 30 selections, the tracklist is remarkably long, but nothing feels rushed.","May 27, 2016"
Exclaim,80,"Its an essential purchase for anyone vaguely interested in music with a soulful pulse.","May 27, 2016"
Spin,80,"With the presence of so many just-off-the-map yet accessible tracks, this set serves as an entry point to a host of artists all sharing a similar aesthetic operating at different levels drawn together by an overarching understanding of how music works on multiple levels. In this, Moodymanns installment of DJ-Kicks may well become the unimpeachably perfect bar against which all subsequent sets will be measured.","May 27, 2016"
XLR8r,80,"Dixon judiciously edited over one-third of the tracks to facilitate flow, his craftiness most evident in the way Talc's breezy part-soft rock/part-Daft Punk hybrid melts into one of Beady Belle's graceful lounge laments. Dixon's taste dips back several decades, but he keeps it relatively contemporary all the way through.","May 27, 2016"
Pitchfork,70,"Theres little sense of genre in an record-industry sense here. The pieces Moodymann mixes together, like the downtempo house of Daniel Bortzs Cuz Youre The One and Swedish folksinger Jos Gonzlezs mournful Remain, shouldnt work, but they keep the calm atmosphere going.","May 27, 2016"
Resident Advisor,60,"While the artistry is evident in his picks, Moodymann's execution here could've use a more deft hand.","May 27, 2016"

Clash Music,80,"Opus, the album, is keenly constructed and an excellent beginning-to-end journey in spite of its size.","May  6, 2016"
PopMatters,80,"Even haters will have to acknowledge Opus as being undeniable for what it is, an iconic collection of 21st-century house music thats so expansive and far-reaching it outgrows its very genre, unable to be contained within any four-walled enclosure.","May  6, 2016"
AllMusic,70,"The more Opus pushes on, something becomes immediately clear: there are absolutely no bad songs on this album.","May  6, 2016"
Tiny Mix Tapes,62,"Opus oscillates between two poles. On the one side are entrancing progressive house numbers like the bookending 'Liam' and 'Opus.'... At the other end of the spectrum are songs informed by Prydzs pop instincts, and these can be more of a mixed bag.","May  6, 2016"
Exclaim,60,"Across two hours, theres plenty of dross: techno-leaning tracks lack danger, while others could soundtrack the bland aspiration of a duty-free shop. But just as he sampled Steve Winwood for his number one hit Call on Me, Prydz knows the value of a yacht-rock vocal.","May  6, 2016"

PopMatters,70,"Its base is the four original songs the band self-released on singles during 2013 and 2014, and each one is represented here, with the references to specific disco and post-disco artists and bygone production touches less obvious, a little more concealed than they are on the 2011 album.","Apr 29, 2016"

DIY Magazine,80,"Although the tracks rarely surprise, frequently falling back on familiar sounds and structures -- loping basslines and synthesizer shadings that escalate at the same tempo always arrive on time, for instance--they're as well-built as those of the debut, and the Lawrences, along with their songwriting partners, cover the ups and downs of falling in and out of love in sharper fashion.","Apr  1, 2016"

The Guardian,40,"The Lawrence bros do pull some new tricks on Caracal. But the album marks the end of Disclosure as a band, and the beginning of Disclosure as a hit-dispensing enterprise that manufactures durable, no-stain, easy-to-clean products to please every audience.","Apr  1, 2016"

Chicago Tribune,68,"Days Gone By focuses on the band's smoky, bedroom-ready style. It's only half the story, but it's still a pretty good one.","Mar 18, 2016"
Drowned In Sound,65,"While there are elements to Days Gone By that still don't sit right, the album is an honest exploration of moods, and Bob Moses' unique combination of dance movement and introspective songcraft engages.","Mar 18, 2016"

Drowned In Sound,80,"A passive listen to Kozes Kicks might just reveal hip-hop love and brilliant talent, but the underlying theme from Koze is simple, but easy to overlook: a genuine love of music.","Oct 30, 2015"

Resident Advisor,70,"When Koze finally gets around to mixing in some house tracks, they're midtempo and bittersweet rather than high-energy floor fillers, and uniformly excellent, particularly Frank & Tony's sublime 'Bring the Sun. One wonders how astonishing the mix would be if it had consisted entirely of tracks like this, but the variety is refreshing, and Koze's adventurous spirit is always admirable.","Oct 30, 2015"

Resident Advisor,85,"Put simply, Alternative Light Source manages to sound both fresh and exciting, and like old Leftfield all at once.","Sep 25, 2015"

Rolling Stone,73,"Fading Love is set up to reward the same focus it demonstrates: if you dig into each new muted meditation and immerse yourself in FitzGerald's bubbling little temples of thought, you'll find yourself entranced.","Sep 11, 2015"
Boston Globe,70,"Fading Love combines emotional complexity with accomplished, evocative production to prove an exception to that rule.","Sep 11, 2015"

The Observer (UK),70,"It's a record that benefits from a pervasive electro-melancholia induced by quaking analogue synths, dulcet arpeggios and fragile vocals, recalling fraternal, dark electro-pop mavens Disclosure. [May 2015, p.97]","Sep 11, 2015"
Pitchfork,70,"An elegant, heartbroken album that wraps its dance floor influence in thick pop overtones.","Sep 11, 2015"
PopMatters,70,"Sometimes it's slick, sometimes it's heartbreaking, but it definitely sounds like it'll suit a festival scenario with lasers on lock... and it's definitely the sound of an artist finding themselves.","Sep 11, 2015"
Clash Music,60,"Fading Love is hard to fault on its own terms, but in a world where there's just so much music, sometimes being decent isn't enough. A bit of nastiness wouldn't go amiss. [May 2015, p.105]","Sep 11, 2015"
AllMusic,60,"By stepping into this unfamiliar territory, hes not only proved that hes the dynamic and hugely talented producer that those early EPs hinted at, but hes ended up just inches away from making that record hes aiming for.","Sep 11, 2015"
Mojo,60,"FitzGerald's only musical foils are guest vocalists, so the contrast between fragile sentiment and driving rhythms feels obsessively and perfectly realized. It's pretty standard stuff, but it works because the album is full of subtly affecting moments that viscerally lock in to a magic-hour state.","Sep 11, 2015"

Resident Advisor,80,"Insides mostly works pretty damn well, and will certainly appeal to fans yearning for the good times hinted at all those years ago.","Aug 28, 2015"
Mixmag,80,"Spacy yet grounded, cosmic yet physical, Insides is a satisfying journey and Fort Romeau's finest music yet.","Aug 28, 2015"
Q Magazine,80,"There might be doses of dancefloor energy through the Balearic string twangs of 'All I Want' and the pulsating, springy pads of Insides, but its definitely the dreamy, mind-expanding cuts that take precedent.","Aug 28, 2015"
The Line of Best Fit,75,"Insides is Fort Romeaus second full-length record, and although it doesnt continue on quite the same upward trend of his recent discography in the risk-taking department, it does boast some of his most fully dimensional and impressively produced work yet.","Aug 28, 2015"
NOW Magazine,70,"There arent any tidy four-minute bangers ready to assault the dance floor on Insides, but with so many DJs doing that already, its all the better that Fort Romeau doesnt feel the need to compete.","Aug 28, 2015"
The Quietus,68,"The gussied-up politeness that has followed Greene throughout his career is still an issue here, making the less adventurous material sound slightly anonymous. That's why the thick textures on 'Folle' stand out so much, or why it's so exciting when Greene lets it all float away on 'Lately.' There are more than enough of these moments to make the record worthwhile.","Aug 28, 2015"

PopMatters,70,"Its strength is the number of differing styles it turns to largely satisfying effect, reasserting Mugwumps status as a producer who knows how to entertain and charm in equal measure. This satisfying, toe-twitching debut-of-sorts will only enhance those claims.","Jul 10, 2015"
Resident Advisor,56,"Beneath its stylish veneer, Unspell lacks substance.","Jul 10, 2015"

The 405,85,"Late Night Tales is a beautifully constructed, cohesive compilation of tracks which proves the ascension of Jon Hopkins to the highest level was no fluke.","Jun 16, 2015"
AllMusic,80,"Even the contrasting consecutive picks--like Darkstar's glistening, skyward 'Hold Me Down' and Holy Other's dragging, alien 'Yr Love'--are compatible, their transitions made with ease. The majority of the mix is beatless and becalmed with periodic surges in energy that never startle.","Jun 16, 2015"
Uncut,75,"This is an inspired collection of songs, even if you do get the feeling Hopkins prefers to spend his late nights alone.","Jun 16, 2015"
musicOMH.com,70,"It's a real labour of love where every track has not only been meticulously thought about and placed, but it's clear that Hopkins has thought tirelessly about how it fits into the wider picture of the collection as a whole.","Jun 16, 2015"
Resident Advisor,70,"Approaching this project as a commissioned artist would, Jon Hopkins' Late Night Tales feels more like a narrative than it does a simple mixtape.","Jun 16, 2015"

AllMusic,80,"Snapshots of old stand-bys come through, but it's in tunes such as the disco tribute Rainbow and the clonky piano of The Drifter that his gift for marrying the modern to history, both recent and ancient, really shines. [Apr 2015, p.108]","Jun 15, 2015"

Uncut,70,"Tthe 11 tracks on Projections have an earthy, authentically humble feel that precludes any thoughts of pretension or exploitation. Romare the producer seems to have a genuine affinity for Romare the painter, which lends a palpable sense of sincerity to Projections.","Jun 15, 2015"
Q Magazine,50,"Without its academic trappings, Projections starts to grate, with its middle-of-the-road niceness and mood of tepid celebration. With them, it's borderline offensive.","Jun 15, 2015"
Uncut,50,"Projections, Fairhurst's first album, designed more for home listening than for dancefloors, is relatively listless, sometimes torpid, and often sounds more like a project than a form of expression.","Jun 15, 2015"

Exclaim,80,"Shorter track lengths and thoughtful sequencing help Body Pill come off not as a series of sketches, but rather a tasting menu of Naples musical talents thats satisfying even after multiple spins.","Jun  8, 2015"
The Guardian,80,"Body Pill is thoroughly understated throughout. It's an odd little album that only shows us part of the Anthony Naples puzzle, which is probably appropriate for an artist whose work seems to come in small and unusual bursts of inspiration.","Jun  8, 2015"
PopMatters,78,"It sounds less like a young producer enjoying the fruits of quick success than a restless experimenter figuring out what to do next. Lucky for us, the woodshed is destination enough.","Jun  8, 2015"
Resident Advisor,75,"Body Pill nods briefly to vintage Detroit techno and no-holds-barred house in between stiffly edging out its own ground on the very crowded floor that is contemporary dance music, often on the same track. [No. 117, p.59]","Jun  8, 2015"

Magnet,74,"The legacy of Dance Manias insouciant, trail-blazing ghetto house is preserved in the citys flourishing juke and footwork communities as much as it lives on through the labels second life; Ghetto Madness is just a reminder.","May 26, 2015"
Uncut,70,"Among the handful of earlier tracks is Steve Poindexter's crucial 'Computer Madness' (1989), technically a Muzique release. The compilers could have just as easily included 'Work That Mutha Fucker' from the same EP.","May 26, 2015"

AllMusic,58,"Stewart's increased output and dearth of exploration gives Archives an unflattering offhandedness, and it also dilutes the potency of Vapor City, like putting together an album is just another item to mark off his to-do list.","Mar 31, 2015"

PopMatters,80,"Blurred is unique, although akin to the old 808 State and LFO efforts where blue rooms met bass music and all the hoodies understood, but it's that same meeting happening in 2014, after house and bass followed their own indie and dubstep routes.","Feb 24, 2015"

Clash Music,80,"Although the music is minimal, propulsive and built for clubs, Avery's formative years spent listening too rock and proto-electro lend the album a dynamic that suits headphone immersion. [Nov 2013, p.102]","Feb 11, 2014"
New Musical Express (NME),80,"Impressively, in a nod to Avery's crowd-pleasing and circuit-bending skills, this is a techno album that seldom sags. [Nov 2013, p.65]","Feb 11, 2014"
Resident Advisor,80,"It sits together as a cohesive body of work rather than a fragmented collection of club moments.","Feb 11, 2014"
Boston Globe,80,"The times have changed enough in the music world that Drone Logic won't get the same recognition and acclaim that albums by Underworld or the Chemical Brothers (or even Plastikman or Orbital) received 20 years previously, but it's every bit as good and expansively musical as anything from that era.","Feb 11, 2014"
Slant Magazine,80,"Its minimal without being clinical, catchy without being clichd and, thanks to the influence of MBV and Neu!, full of sonic left turns.","Feb 11, 2014"

Mixmag,72,"You might find it too retro, or just not hip enough, but there is zero second-guessing on Avery's part: never does he glance over his shoulder with a nod to UK bass culture or a capitulate to a straight house track.","Feb 11, 2014"
Mojo,70,"Drone Logic has peaks that dwarf its troughs, though, making Averys brave debut worth buying for its four best tracks alone.","Feb 11, 2014"

Q Magazine,70,"The mood album implied by the title is really a mood EP waiting to be extracted, but approach it as a normal Kaskade effort with a bit more risk and a bit more richer music and the rewards will follow suit.","Feb 11, 2014"
Uncut,63,"About half the record is orthodox Kaskade--clean-cut rave with a dreamy shimmer--that fans will devour, but which doesnt move the genre much. But the other half is a laudable effort to broaden the palette for what big-tent EDM can do.","Feb 11, 2014"
The Quietus,60,"While Kaskades tidy productions are a definite pro, few would object if the producer dug in every once and a while with an extra drop or two.","Feb 11, 2014"

Pitchfork,80,"Its a poised, carefully executed balance that captures Ikonika in an intriguing period of transition.","Feb 11, 2014"
Clash Music,80,"Ultimately, Aerotropolis is not just a statement of Ikonikas personal growth and reinvigoration, but a measured statement of British electronic musics broader lift-off.","Feb 11, 2014"
AllMusic,80,"Ikonika has delivered one of 2013's definitive summer albums. It's time to get happy.","Feb 11, 2014"

New Musical Express (NME),60,"The album doesnt bring anything new to the table, opting instead to build on established structures.","Feb 11, 2014"

Exclaim,60,"While its hard not to view the five solo instrumentals as some of the strongest work here, overall Getting Closer is well worth some private investigating.","Nov 12, 2013"
Tiny Mix Tapes,60,"Getting Closer comes off as an undecided jumble of background and foreground music. Nice, but not necessary, this one falls somewhere between a promising debut and glossy, pretty wallpaper.","Nov 12, 2013"
AllMusic,60,"As nice and welcoming as Getting Closer is, it'll never challenge you.","Nov 12, 2013"

Fact Magazine (UK),80,"It is raw, retro nouveau, deep house bangers like 'When A Fire Starts To Burn' and 'Stimulation' that make this a perfect Brit companion piece to Daft Punk's recent rebootings of disco history. [Aug 2013, p.69]","Nov  4, 2013"
Mixmag,80,"Its a pop record, a history lesson and--for those uninitiated in the funky UK house tradition--a gateway drug all in one.","Nov  4, 2013"
Pitchfork,80,"Settle may be a lot less rowdy than Basement Jaxx's bellwether 1999 album Remedy, but it pulls off a similarly timely coup by pulling together a number of clubland threads, imposing a keen pop sensibility and idiosyncratic vision, and riding the crest of a rising tide. [Jul 2013, p.104]","Nov  4, 2013"
Consequence of Sound,80,"Considering all the shrewd alliances and its polished attack, Settle seems like it was designed to be 2013's acceptable dance album. That said, any purist who denies its pleasures is a crank.","Nov  4, 2013"
CMJ,80,"Settle is a rare animal: an EDM album that actually flows like an album should. Listening to it, there's a feeling that as much thought went into the track sequencing as went into the sequenced rhythms.","Nov  4, 2013"
PopMatters,80,"Its not perfect--Grab Her and Stimulation both outstay their welcome and the glitchy Second Chance feels like its from a different album--but its a consistently thrilling debut.","Nov  4, 2013"
Billboard.com,80,"A pop album brimming with imagination, vibrant melodies and, yes, a fair bit of formula.","Nov  4, 2013"
Beats Per Minute (formerly One Thirty BPM),80,"It's the fact that Disclosure make bookish, aurally factual electronica sound so carefree that makes Settle such an artistic success.","Nov  4, 2013"

Exclaim,70,"Even if Settle quiets the unreasonable expectations surrounding it by offering a solid collection of smart dance tracks, some songs do not fully live up to the hype.","Nov  4, 2013"
Spin,70,"Throughout, Settle will blind you with so much sheen youll want to tile your bathroom in it. Sadly, the London Grammar-featuring Help Me Lose My Mind is a bit of an unnecessary cool-down.","Nov  4, 2013"
DIY Magazine,60,"Any band that can turn over vocal duties as often as they hold onto them and somehow make all the music sound like their own is a band worth watching, and despite its inconsistency and even its lack of imagination, there are a lot of thrills to be had in this hour.","Nov  4, 2013"
The Telegraph (UK),60,"Its a shame that their debut album is so short on variety and surprises, and doesnt capture the imagination past a couple of listens.","Nov  4, 2013"
Clash Music,60,"Two of these cuts have already graced the top 10; the rest of Disclosure's debut album showcases a sound in which the echoes of two-step, UK funky and older house records recombine into a surprisingly timely and moreish soundtrack.","Nov  4, 2013"
The Guardian,40,"The only thing Settle succeeds at is repurposing generic late 90s funky house into a sound that people seem to have been brainwashed into thinking is new and exciting.","Nov  4, 2013"
Los Angeles Times,20,"Now, it appears to have been reduced to simply a checklist of familiar sounds and effects, harnessed to the dullest beats imaginable, and dependent on outside collaborators for interest.","Nov  4, 2013"

New Musical Express (NME),70,"Most of Raw Solutions is a working-through of moves from Chicago House from Juke to footwork to Ghetto House, and while well done, doesn't leave its own stamp as an outside interpretation. [May 2013, p.66]","Oct 22, 2013"
No Ripcord,70,"It unravels itself while unraveling you at the same time. Its happy-go-lucky on the surface, more mellowed out underneath.","Oct 22, 2013"

The Quietus,20,"The majority of tunes on offer here do very little to build on the ideas and panache exposed on Soft Control.","Oct 22, 2013"

The Independent (UK),80,"At times, Letherette gives the impression of being on the fringes of a big party, moving in and out of the action as the mood strikes--and it's this mood, sophisticated but not overly mannered, that makes the album so listenable.","Oct  7, 2013"
Resident Advisor,70,"Despite something of a slow start, Letherette builds into an expansive, absorbing album, spanning a huge variety of influences and threading them together impressively within a coherent framework.","Oct  7, 2013"
Fact Magazine (UK),70,"A debut album of soaring highs and some affecting melancholic soundscapes tempered slightly by just a few forgettable lulls.","Oct  7, 2013"
Pitchfork,70,"Ultimately, the albums electro-house elements feel like comparative cheap thrills placed amongst the wealth of knowledge and craftsmanship elsewhere on the EP.","Oct  7, 2013"
The Wire,60,"Too often, Letherette is synthetic and manufactured, but in those slower, stranger moments it feels like the real deal.","Oct  7, 2013"
CMJ,50,"The album is ridiculously fun and surprising, in that it sounds like much older UK electronic rooted in the present. What's quite out of place though are the distinctly lagging tracks that dawdle across the album.","Oct  7, 2013"
AllMusic,40,"Their take on the latter's [Rustie's] maximal funk inevitably lacks the shock of the new, a heard-it-all-before feeling which persists through bumping house jams and detours into vintage jazz. [Jun 2013, p.100]","Oct  7, 2013"

XLR8r,100,"Once you delve in youre taken on a guided tour through the duos illustrious back catalogue in a quite majestic way.","Sep 10, 2013"
Tiny Mix Tapes,75,"Its all about context with Live: each moment is a build to and release from the next.","Sep 10, 2013"
AllMusic,75,"Perhaps realizing that it's divisive and reductive to only dabble in one or the other, SMD opts for a satisfactory middle ground in its live sets, rearranging the pair's accessible pop moments as skeletal reincarnations of themselves.","Sep 10, 2013"
Drowned In Sound,70,"The only thing lacking is a greater presence of the crowd on the record that seems to be have mixed down, but it is the audible ecstasy of audience participation that truly makes a live album, though here the delicate simplicity and precise execution of the music more than makes up for it.","Sep 10, 2013"
musicOMH.com,70,"In the end, it's still just a live album, but this sideline release is a must for fans, recommended for the casual techno head, and worth checking if a pumping, hypnotic, and otherworldly journey sounds attractive.","Sep 10, 2013"
Fact Magazine (UK),70,"Live uses Simian Mobile Discos past to signpost their future--resulting in a record which is occasionally frustrating and even underwhelming, but one which is also a demonstration of confident execution, and a promising forecast of mature dance music to come.","Sep 10, 2013"
Resident Advisor,60,"Although Simian Mobile Disco have the ability to give each track its own distinct personality, Live is a mere curiosity for even the most refined technocrats.","Sep 10, 2013"

Exclaim,75,"Pharaohs succeed principally because they don't feel the weight of all those influences bearing down upon them.","Jul 29, 2013"
Q Magazine,70,"Pharaohs aren't inventing anything new here but what they do well is grab the best bits from all the danceable electronic music that has come before them and consolidate it into something shiny and new.","Jul 29, 2013"
Mixmag,70,"Only a handful of Replicant Moods' tracks make a lasting impression, but this foursome still consistently gets the entropy-to-pattern ratio just right.","Jul 29, 2013"
Pitchfork,70,"It works because you can tell how much Pharaohs love house music, how much they seem to wish theyd been there back when it was taking off in the mid-80s.","Jul 29, 2013"

XLR8r,80,"While the mix is strong throughout, its beginning and end are particularly captivating.","Jun 25, 2013"
DIY Magazine,73,"The resulting sound feels neither modern nor particularly retro, although it's certainly arguable that the music's buffed up, high-gloss late night classicism resembles just a bit too strongly the kind of music that, say, Poker Flat label boss Steve Bug was playing nine years ago.","Jun 25, 2013"
AllMusic,70,"It's a boisterously enjoyable and skilfully compressed journey, and a further evolution in an already promising mix series.","Jun 25, 2013"
Drowned In Sound,70,"Social Experiment 003 is an after-hours adventure into the perverse seduction of tech-house.","Jun 25, 2013"

Pitchfork,80,"Thoroughly enjoyable and high in replay value, this will be most valuable for younger listeners for whom H&LA functioned as a point of entry into house music.","Jun 11, 2013"
AllMusic,70,"If Butler falls slightly short of convincing that this particular brand of old will be made new again, it remains hard to find fault with his survey of all the fun we could have had.","Jun 11, 2013"
XLR8r,70,"Despite its strict adherence to traditional and relatively straightforward dance aesthetics, the album is often showy, flaunting both its nods to authenticity and an impressive showcase of the genre's low-tech production style.","Jun 11, 2013"
No Ripcord,70,"While the mix is peppered with samples from Butler's yoga guru, Parahamansa Yogananda, aiming for a spiritual vibe, this set is really one big party.","Jun 11, 2013"
AllMusic,60,"It's great, but for all Butler's desire to bring this to the now it's best enjoyed by those who are able to take this as a polished trip down memory lane or as a launch pad to jump back into the history of dance music.","Jun 11, 2013"
Pitchfork,10,"These are the cheaply licensed other songs that you fast-forwarded through on that copy of Dance Mix [Insert Year] to get to the two or three hits that really shook up the club. You skipped them then and you should skip them now too.","Jun 11, 2013"

Resident Advisor,85,"Armed with a collection of adrenaline-pumping beats and diverse vocal appearances, it's a musical force that continues to establish Zimmerman's place among the house music greats.","Jun  4, 2013"

Exclaim,60,"Flying in the face of his public persona, this is a sprawling (could be tighter) and humble (could be more persuasive) Deadmau5 album and one best suited for established fans.","Jun  4, 2013"
Drowned In Sound,60,"Deadmau5 brings a love of spectacle--and the humor of a natural ham--to his strobe-lit club anthems.","Jun  4, 2013"
PopMatters,50,"At his best - 'The Veldt,' 'Closer,' and 'Channel 42,' which has a nice, Cameo-like wah-funk wiggle - Deadmau5 is a topflight roots-of-EDM mimic. At his worst, he's a troll.","Jun  4, 2013"
Paste Magazine,40,"Album Title Goes Here is simply, and honestly, a pointless release, a record designed for two very different crowds, yet lacking the ammunition to even moderately please anyone.","Jun  4, 2013"
Mixmag,40,"Right now, for all its impressive fireworks, it feels hollow as its title.","Jun  4, 2013"
Consequence of Sound,40,"It's derivative, cliched and gives the impression of having been made by someone who's never danced in their life, but in a purely technical sense, it's extremely well produced, punchy, powerful, with a strong grasp of dynamics and occasional flashes of a deft melodic touch.","Jun  4, 2013"
Q Magazine,10,"What strikes you first about Album Title Goes Here, apart from the moronic postmodernism-for-tweens title, is how resolutely un-danceable it is.","Jun  4, 2013"

PopMatters,85,"Every selection here is strong, and though scholars may have heard the lion's share of these tracks already, this is a sturdy, enlightening gateway into a realm that isn't easily penetrable for those who weren't there.","Apr 23, 2013"

CMJ,70,"The Tron: Legacy Soundtrack is quality, but it's easy to ignore, wholly capable of disappearing into the background--which is ultimately how soundtracks are supposed to be, is it not?","Sep 26, 2011"
musicOMH.com,70,"For all of its familiar traces, this soundtrack offers little more than 22 pleasant teasers to distract die-hards until the duo undergo a proper reboot.","Sep 26, 2011"
AllMusic,70,"As a stand-alone album, what Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo and Thomas Bangalter have created won't sate the disco heads screaming for more club material, however as an accomplished score it can only make a legendary film yet more cherished.","Sep 26, 2011"
PopMatters,70,"Although not musically revolutionary, Tron: Legacy suggests the adrenaline rush of a black panther roaming nearby in the darkness, heard but not yet seen.","Sep 26, 2011"
New Musical Express (NME),70,"That Daft Punk's Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo and Thomas Bangalter would score Tron: Legacy seems destined.","Sep 26, 2011"
Beats Per Minute (formerly One Thirty BPM),63,"It's a hint of what may come, a bridge to something greater than this first, tentative attempt at a more ornate sound.","Sep 26, 2011"
Los Angeles Times,60,"The fortunes of this soundtrack will ultimately rest with the success of the film but its brooding mix of old and new styles certainly wets your appetite to see it.","Sep 26, 2011"
The A.V. Club,60,"Daft Punk have done their homework, and there's enough here to suggest that, with a bit of debugging, they'll have no problem hitting all the right buttons next time.","Sep 26, 2011"
Entertainment Weekly,60,"For once they look to be towing the line rather than drawing it a new. [Jan 2011, p.85]","Sep 26, 2011"
Consequence of Sound,60,"Overall Tron: Legacy is but faint clanging, drowned out by rent-a-string-section romanticism; like sad robots banging on a sound-stage door. [Jan. 2011, p. 95]","Sep 26, 2011"
Boston Globe,60,"Whether Daft Punk have created a worthy soundtrack is for filmgoers to decide. As for the album they've made - it's so-so mood music, full of dramatic, string-suffused sounds that are sometimes moving and sometimes just there.","Sep 26, 2011"
Clash Music,60,"It might all work brilliantly in the cinema, allied to Tron: Legacy's 3D visuals. If it does, it wouldn't be the first Daft Punk album to be reconsidered over time: people certainly revised their opinion of Human After All after seeing its tracks performed live.","Sep 26, 2011"
BBC Music,55,"While the classical arrangements mark a new style for Daft Punk, it's hardly revelatory in the sphere of movie scores at large.","Sep 26, 2011"
Spin,50,"The music is so devoid of anything to grab onto, listening to it is rather like plummeting at speed through the artificial landscape constructed for the film. [Mar 2011, p.48]","Sep 26, 2011"
Chicago Tribune,50,"It's all too clear Disney wanted the cachet, not the daft nor the punk. Trick yourselves into thinking the robots are twisting some radical new spin on the form if you wish, but I'm logging off now.","Sep 26, 2011"

The Telegraph (UK),80,"Every track on here is solid, and that's a feat for an electronic dance duo who can lazily fall into easy repetition for people in clubs who just want a constant beat.","Sep 13, 2011"
Dot Music,74,"If the results aren't necessarily the kind of up-front and accessible electro that would appeal to their 'Hustler'-adoring base, it's definitely an interesting shot at regrouping and concocting a few rapidly refined ideas.","Sep 13, 2011"
Uncut,70,"Delicacies proves that this aging duo still have the fire in the belly of their hard drive.","Sep 13, 2011"
Mojo,70,"Whipping up a surplus of creeping, insistent sophistication--climaxing with ping-ponging head-wrecker 'Aspic'--you can once again envisage techno overlords such as Sven Vath dropping SMD, rather than daytime radio DJs.","Sep 13, 2011"
Rolling Stone,60,"For a young, non-jaded Pantha Du Prince fan, though, this could resonate yet.","Sep 13, 2011"
The Guardian,60,"Delicacies lacks the pop craftsmanship and euphoric electro of Attack and the singular outstanding tracks of Temporary Pleasures, never attempting to introduce vocals to supplement their evident ability to create an intriguing techno dance track.","Sep 13, 2011"

Pitchfork,76,"This Stockholm-based DJ outfit scored a dance hit earlier this year with 'One (Your Name),' its hard-hitting collaboration with Pharrell Williams of N*E*R*D. But separately, the men of Swedish House Mafia-Axwell, Sebastian Ingrosso and Steve Angello-have been rocking dancefloors for years, so here we have a 24-track primer designed to update new fans on each artist's earlier work.","Aug 16, 2011"
The Wire,60,"Chained as they are to the demands of the dancefloor, there's a little room for subtlety in these frantic mash-ups of Coldplay and Empire Of The Sun, but then whoever did their thinking under strobe lights? [Dec 2010, p.115]","Aug 16, 2011"
Slant Magazine,60,"Not every DJ dream team is up to the challenge of creating great original tracks, though, and it's hard to criticize Swedish House Mafia when their mix is otherwise such a blast.","Aug 16, 2011"
PopMatters,56,"From the Midlands to the Midwest, the mediocre couldn't be more on fire.","Aug 16, 2011"
Pitchfork,40,"It's exhausting, and somehow impatient. Swedish House Mafia don't earn their big moments, they throw them in whenever the ideas pot runs dry.","Aug 16, 2011"
Clash Music,40,"An appearance by David Guetta reminds us that it could be much worse, and an excursion into klezmer techno on Valodja briefly threatens to be interesting; but in the main, Swedish House Mafia reduce hedonism to pure function, a facsimile of ecstasy that winds up grim, joyless and oddly sexless.","Aug 16, 2011"
New Musical Express (NME),10,"To account for the offensively retrospective nature of this trawl of commonplace dance-floor garbage (we're talking Coldplay, Candi Staton and Justice), I must assume, first, that they spent the last two years in a timewarp somewhere between 1993 and 2006. And secondly, that they spent this time in trashy commercial nightclubs, where glowsticks never die, dancefloors rotate and there's a price reduction for hen parties.","Aug 16, 2011"

Alternative Press,80,"Eight satisfying songs of rhythm and groove later, Underworld pulls a fast one, yanking the cord with album finale 'Louisiana,' which features beautiful keys, languid vocals and a gentle, time-keeping beat that lulls listeners into the blissful ether.","Jul  5, 2011"
musicOMH.com,80,"With experiments in disco, dubstep and drum'n'bass all unmistakably Underworld, Barking is the sound of veterans re-energised. [Oct 2010, p.","Jul  5, 2011"
Billboard.com,80,"Thirty years into their collaboration, Underworld's Rick Smith and Karl Hyde continue to sit at the forefront of dance music innovation. Barking is just further proof that Underworld isn't going anywhere.","Jul  5, 2011"
Q Magazine,76,"Even the forecast backlash from fans of the trance era can't dent Barking's relentless enthusiasm, and given the sufficient exposure and time, everyone should be able to party to it. It's just that for an Underworld album it sounds distinctly un-Underworld, and more like someone's asked Smith and Hyde to ghost-write a Now! compilation.","Jul  5, 2011"
AllMusic,76,"Where Underworld was once a dark foil to what was generally a culture of peace, love and hedonism, in these grim times, Barking is a relatively upper's affair, and something of a techno's-greatest-bits.","Jul  5, 2011"
Filter,70,"They may not be sticking their necks out as pioneers now but it's not important --they are never less than themselves, and superficial quibbles aside this is the sound of musicians with nothing to prove and everything to give.","Jul  5, 2011"
BBC Music,70,"Underworld is freed up to focus on crafting memorable tunes that hark back to their electronica heyday, as well as more personal, coherent lyrics. Earnest emotions surprisingly suit these dance-floor surrealists.","Jul  5, 2011"
The Guardian,70,"The album can't sustain the energy of early tracks like 'Bird' and 'Scribble,' but while the blaze lasts, it's definitely worth warming yourself up on. [Oct 2010, p.120]","Jul  5, 2011"
Clash Music,70,"Underworld's new album is distinctly Underworld, and has a greater cohesiveness than those previous two full lengths, as well as a greater appeal.","Jul  5, 2011"
CMJ,60,"While each track sounds different to the one that preceded it, they all manage to fit together as a coherent whole. Barking is still a credible effort and a pleasant listen, but it is also unremarkable and, had it been released by artists whose fame didn't precede them, it probably would not have made any waves.","Jul  5, 2011"
Uncut,60,"As it stands though, Barking is a mostly-solid album let down by a couple of weak links.","Jul  5, 2011"
Urb,60,"Although this is hardly Underworld at their finest, the duo's songwriting fits the mainstream productions and results in a solid dance album for the 2010s--music for aging-raver activities like driving cars, pushing swings, or jogging on treadmills.","Jul  5, 2011"
cokemachineglow,60,"The duo have remained one of the few constants in UK dance music. [Oct 2010, p.120]","Jul  5, 2011"
Filter,59,"So Barking stays the course, with the added prospect of a fitter, happier Underworld on the horizon. It's about time.","Jul  5, 2011"
BBC Music,50,"This collaboration-heavy eighth album tends to fail when it experiments.","Jul  5, 2011"
Spin,50,"Despite its title, Barking is, in some ways, the most tuneful Underworld album yet, which isn't saying a lot.","Jul  5, 2011"
Alternative Press,50,"Overall, Barking is a hit-and-miss situation. [Summer 2010, p.89]","Jul  5, 2011"
PopMatters,40,"This time Karl Hyde and Rick Smith team up with a revolving cast of dance producers (Appleblim, Al Tourettes, High Contrast), hoping one of the many approaches to rock-meets-techno will again produce a bankable hit. Surprise! That doesn't happen.","Jul  5, 2011"

Drowned In Sound,80,"Produced by Boyz Noize, this is the sound of a rook shuffling with a maverick king, full of harpsichords and pianos and sexy European beats; it will arouse the mind and stimulate interesting positions.","Jun 14, 2011"
musicOMH.com,80,"His sixth record fuses together the best of his ability, the remarkable piano compositions and absurd lyricism, with production outsourced to Berlin electronic producer Boys Noize.","Jun 14, 2011"
AllMusic,70,"Chilly Gonzales has at least done a fine job shaping its aural side into a stand alone piece. It may be a grab bag, but Ivory Tower's contents are largely satisfying.","Jun 14, 2011"
Q Magazine,70,"While a talented producer in his own right, here we find Chilly collaborating with Berlin dance producer Boys Noize, re-rendering the elaborate, minimalist-flavoured piano debuted on Solo Piano as louche, polished Euro-disco with one beady eye on the chill-out dollar. It is often much better than this sounds.","Jun 14, 2011"
Pitchfork,70,"There is enough great music here to make Ivory Tower a worthwhile listen, but this soundtrack drifts in the void between the two extremes of his back catalogue.","Jun 14, 2011"
New Musical Express (NME),60,"This Boys Noize-produced return is nothing if not perverse. [Oct 2010, p.108]","Jun 14, 2011"
The A.V. Club,60,"The feeling remains, however, that Ivory Tower the album will be at its most effective when the visuals come in to play. Many of its instrumentals lack an essential element of either melody or art, so it's safe to assume they will come to life better on screen.","Jun 14, 2011"
Under The Radar,60,"He reins in the Liberace-meets-Lenny Bruce schtick on his sixth album, a curiously anodyne effort helmed by Berlin electro buccaneer Boyz Noize. [Oct 2010, p.89]","Jun 14, 2011"
NOW Magazine,50,"Gonzales isn't an innovative dance producer, and there's not much pop music in play here either, making Ivory Tower a rather run-of-the-mill soundtrack--one of the many that can't be separated from their films.","Jun 14, 2011"

New Musical Express (NME),100,"Rooty is the second straight triumph from a pair of producer/DJs who look set to carry the torch for dancefloor electronica in the years to come.","Mar  1, 2011"
Urb,91,"No catchier collection of jingles has come to my attention since Steve Miller made his mint off jet airliners.","Mar  1, 2011"
PopMatters,91,"But sound for sound's sake isn't what makes the disc work; it's the recurring female singers, who add forlorn soul to the rhythms.","Mar  1, 2011"
BBC Music,90,"Yes, it's as good as the last one, maybe better.","Mar  1, 2011"
Drowned In Sound,90,"The nerve of it all is breathtaking. Turbo-beats poke up a gospel-jazz revivalist meeting, a mariachi band wanders into the hazy disco sashay of 'Broken Dreams', a Gary Numan sample gets bludgeoned to credibility in the Van Helden-esque pogo of 'Where's Your Head At?'.","Mar  1, 2011"
Q Magazine,90,"Rooty revels in exploiting rhythmic combinations that shouldn't work--but definitely do.","Mar  1, 2011"
musicOMH.com,90,"Basement Jaxx traffics in some of the most shamelessly insistent and inventive beats around.","Mar  1, 2011"
Uncut,90,"Basement Jaxx do this so much better than anyone else, including Daft Punk, that you root for their mad programed sounds and unknown cast of determined singers. It's totally daft disco, sexy and sweaty, stupid and stupendous. This is pop.","Mar  1, 2011"
AllMusic,80,"The album misses the addictive funk of 'Red Alert', the off beat quirks of 'Yo Yo' and the engulfing production depth of 'Same Old Show'. But it's a powerful package and a proof that the Basement Jaxx have the confidence and vision to pursue their own path.","Mar  1, 2011"
AllMusic,80,"Basement Jaxx create real songs around their chugging house beats.","Mar  1, 2011"
Village Voice (Consumer Guide),80,"At a time when Fatboy Slim has gone chill-out, Orbital have gone noodly, and Underworld, nd Prodigy seem to have just gone somewhere else, Basement Jaxx are, happily, on hand with another brilliantly messy blueprint for UK dance music - and dance music that you can actually dance to, at that.","Mar  1, 2011"
Entertainment Weekly,80,"On Rooty, Basement Jaxx refines the ambitious but untidy sprawl of its debut into a carnivalesque mix of two-step, house, funk, and disco with a modern take on George Clinton's late-seventies mission of 'rescuing dance music from the blahs.'","Mar  1, 2011"
Village Voice,80,"Despite Rooty's many delights, it feels like Basement Jaxx didn't really know how to top Remedy. [Aug 2001, p.127]","Mar  1, 2011"
New Musical Express (NME),80,"In pursuing the anarchic, joyous mash-up of their debut Remedy to its twisted conclusion, Basement Jaxx find themselves in androgynous, genre-bending territory that is Prince-ly in spirit even when it isnt in sound.","Mar  1, 2011"
Billboard,80,"Rooty boasts a raw, bustling edge and compulsive experimentalism closer in spirit to the hypersyncopated, R&B-flavored two-step garage currently ruling London clubland. [Jun/Jul 2001, p.104]","Mar  1, 2011"
The A.V. Club,80,"It's no different from the formula that made Fatboy Slim and the Chemical Bores such big hits, but something's different this time around: Basement Jaxx have soul.","Mar  1, 2011"
Launch.com,80,"'Rooty' isn't going to change your world - 'Remedy' did that - but it is another indispensable, truly, properly, madly inventive and utterly enjoyable album of the sort that, at the moment, only Basement Jaxx make.","Mar  1, 2011"
Dot Music,70,"Eschewing the DJ-friendly club format they perfected on 1999's Remedy, the Jaxx are now writing R&B-flavored pop songs... But their success is hit-and-miss... [Jul 2001, p.60]","Mar  1, 2011"
Sonicnet,70,"With Rooty they fine-tune their classy thump into a pop-house hybrid that owes something to a little guy named Prince.","Mar  1, 2011"
Q Magazine,67,"Teeters on '80s synth cheese every now and again.","Mar  1, 2011"
New York Magazine (Vulture),60,"Like Remedy, Rooty is either a brilliantly innovative record, or an unlistenable mess, depending on your point of view. To my ear it's somewhere in between, the work of two very talented house producers and songwriters with a taste for old-school sounds that's sometimes entertaining, but often unfortunate.","Mar  1, 2011"
Spin,50,"Oh, there are moments of pure wonder, to be sure, but they're sandwiched between tracks that either retread old ideas or execute less impressive new ones.","Mar  1, 2011"
Mojo,38,"A few fatal flaws eclipse all of Rooty's abundant qualities. Basement Jaxx have taken kitsch a few steps too far.","Mar  1, 2011"

Blender,80,"It's Cole's deep vocal tracks, though, that steal the show.","Feb 22, 2011"

Alternative Press,72,"Despite the initial futuristic impression, Cole proves himself to be guilty of the same superficial high concepts that taint far too many dance music albums. Still, there's much to recommend here, especially when Cole sticks to the grooves.","Feb 22, 2011"
Rolling Stone,70,"The very qualities that annoyed me about it at first - the 'proper' musicality, the lack of rough edges - are what draws me to it now.","Feb 22, 2011"
E! Online,70,"Cole is a slick producer, dropping just the right sounds to impress fellow DJs and keep club kids doing the boogie fever.","Feb 22, 2011"
PopMatters,60,"With the gleaming, self-aware production as well as both Danny Vicious' embarrassing rapping and Elisabeth Troy's overly soulful vocals, it's clear that Cole wants respect at every turn. Despite the consequences.","Feb 22, 2011"
Armchair DJ,50,"Its way too often here that everything new and interesting about two-step gets brushed aside for suspiciously lite jazz and limp mixes of dancefloor hits.","Feb 22, 2011"
