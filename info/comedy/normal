9,"An emotionally charged album that manages to balance somber introspection with an embracing sense of warmth. There is enough weight in the writing and wide sweeping synthetic instruments to avoid sounding airy or softening impact. Like their debut album, Majical Cloudz's minimalism is effective as a method, far beyond novelty or accident. Are You Alone? is a near-perfect refinement of a unique and genuine sound.",1,1,"Oct 18, 2015"

10,"Possibly his best work since 'Even Worse', Weird Al forays against a plethora of genres for his latest album, from rap with his parody of Izzy Azalea's 'Fancy' ('Handy') to indie-rock, lampooning Imagine Dragons' 'Radioactive' ('Inactive'). 'Word Crimes', a parody of Robin Thicke's pop-hit 'Blurred Lines' stands out particularly for dismissing the controversial, arguably sexist tone of the original to promote a light-hearted message of literary education, particularly relevant in our world of internet acronyms and emoticons.
Al consistently exhibits his magnificent ability to pinpoint elements of popular culture, moreso than his previous records; it feels less disjointed than the likes of the forgettable 'Alpocalypse' or even 'Alapalooza', a record truly suited for the social networking age. Even the album art is worth a giggle. 5*",0,0,"Jul 15, 2014"

9,"The returning Grammy-nominated masters of frap (fake rap) come out strong with their best album to date. Nowhere else will you find Pharrell Williams dreaming about hugging your mom in a Suburu Hatchback, Kristen Wiig jealously imagining a man with an unfortunate wardrobe malfunction, or Kendrick Lamar as a good financial adviser. Yes, The Lonely Island did it. The Lonely Island have created the ultimate mockery of rap and pop music and somehow made it sound better than every pop artist. Although the album has about ten times the profanity of the previous two albums, the significance within the songs really pack a punch. The Lonely Island is a revolutionary trio of creative frappers who know what's up. They take the blueprints of crappy pop music, make it unique, and blow every other artist out of the water. Although they aren't very family friendly, their lyrics express the true issues in the world... and plenty of penis jokes.",1,1,"Jun 11, 2013"

6,"There's one thing that I'll say gives this an edge compared to their last 2 albums. While Incredibad and Turtleneck & Chain were good on their own merits, it was hard to get out of the head that half of those albums were basically SNL compilations from the last couple years, especially Incredibad which had a couple tracks dating back to 2005.  Here though, besides 3-Way, every track is from 2013, so it's easier to look at this as one cohesive project.  Also because of that there aren't those awkward tracks where it's not nearly as entertaining without the video.  But going to the music itself, one more advantage this album has is that here they're incorporating something they haven't before: cleverness.  Even though they were funny for the most part before, it was more in a purely goofy way that even the most simple-minded of people could get 100%.  While that's obviously the general vibe here, you can tell these ideas took a little more thought, particularly in the way they make fun of hip hop trends.  For example look at Go Kindergarten & Semicolon, which make fun of dance-command rap songs & the hashtag-rap rhyming scheme respectively in the hyper-exaggerated attitude that they've made their name with, with the latter having a double joke between the actual verses & the last few seconds I won't spoil.  Other notable ones in this department include I Run NY (feat. my favorite guest singer here Billie Joe Armstrong), Spell It Out & YOLO.  And 'Perfect Saturday' ends the album on a great note.
The main problem with this album though is that while the highs are higher, the lows are much lower.  Looking through the track list, to me it's extremely front-loaded, with almost all of the throwaway tracks coming in the back half.  Tracks like Hugs, I'm a Hustler (Song?), Spring Break Anthem, I Don't Give a Honk, I F*cked My Aunt & We Are a Crowd just feel like filler made to pad the album out to reach that 40-minute length, with lazy writing & few actual jokes whatsoever.  Not only that, but 3-Way (The Golden Rule) disappointed me as the 3rd in the trilogy following Dick in a Box & Motherlover. Why?  Because unlike those songs, which are are so outlandish & absurd in concept you can't help but laugh, this is just one sub-par dirty joke with a couple one-liners thrown in.  It's not as effective because it's more down-to-earth, and I'm sad to say I recommend skipping it.  There's also one instance in the track The Compliments where the joke is frustratingly explained in the last 30 seconds via a guest verse from Too $hort.
The Wack Album doesn't entirely live up to its name.  It's not as consistently good as Turtleneck & Chain, but the better tracks here are some of the best they've ever done.  If you were annoyed by The Lonely Island's previous stuff, then this won't do much to impress you outside of some refinement here & there.  But for fans & anyone burned out on serious subject matter & just wanting an album to make them laugh a bit, I think it's worth a listen.

8,"The album as a whole is a solid effort, some jokes fall short but it's to be expected in this difficult genre. Lonely Island use satire throughout to address several modern societal issues. A recurring theme is the nonsensical and materialistic nature of 21st century Hip-Hop. At the same time they make it sound good, and credible as a track in its own right, exposing the formulaic hits spurned out by major record labels today. However the album retains a certain level of immaturity typical of TLI, and despite the absence of a stand-out hit fans of the group should enjoy 'The Wack Album'",0,0,"Jun 18, 2013"

9,"I don't think that this man can make a bad album. This album is no exception. He creatively uses themes and songs that everyone knows and creates his own 'Frankenstein' of a song with each one. He offers a wider variety of song choices in this album with pop parodies (from Lady Gaga, Taylor Swift, Miley Cyrus, etc.) and alternative/rock parodies (from The White Stripes, The Doors, and Queen). The polka in this album is one of the better ones, poking fun at #1 hits on the radio and other popular songs that everyone is tired of. The absolute best of this album are 'Perform This Way', 'CNR', 'Craigslist', 'Skipper Dan', 'Polka Face', and 'Ringtone'. Another gem in the music industry by the funniest parody man alive, 'Weird Al' Yankovic! Buy it now!",1,1,"Jun 27, 2011"

3,"The master of music parody is back! One small problem, he clearly forgot to bring his A-game to this album. In fact, it's probably one of his worst albums of his discography. Don't expect classic parodies that will stick in your head like Eat It, Fat, Addicted to Spuds, Smells Like Nirvana, White & Nerdy, so on and so forth. Most of the parodies on this album feel forced and uninspired. The obligatory polka medley is boring and hackneyed and a vast majority of his 'original' content was available a year ago on the 'Internet Leaks' EP. For almost 5 years between albums, and nearly a year between the release of the 'Internet Leaks', I expected better. It feels almost as though Al would be content to drop doing parodies all together and just make pseudo-parody, period, pieces like the Doors-esque 'Craigslist'.",0,1,"Jun 21, 2011"

8,"I've been a massive fan of Weird Al for almost all my life; I own physical copies of all his albums, even the ones I don't think are all that great. Coming from that perspective how does 'Alpocalypse' compare to the many that came before it?Well, it holds up pretty well. No, it isn't one of his absolute best like, 'In 3D' or 'Off the Deep End', but it's even further from the 'Polka Party'/'Poodle Hat' side of the spectrum. Really, it's a solid disc full of thoroughly amusing music. Yes, a lot of it is not completely new. Almost half the album came off the 'Internet Leaks' EP. Even the Polka medley was being played on Al's last tour.Looking at it song by song, 'Perform this Way' starts us off. This is one of the more unimpressive songs on the disk in my opinion. Sure it manages a few good, silly lines, but it's one of those songs that really needs the accompanying visuals of the music video to be great. On it's own, it's a little lacking. Yet it's okay, because following that we have a real winner in 'CNR'. This song is a rocking and hilarious send up of The White Stripes, Chuck Norris Facts and the late great Charles Nelson Reiley.After that, we have our second parody, 'TMZ', a parody of a song by Taylor Swift. This song is very smartly written. I'm not very familiar with the original song, but I still rather enjoy this cut. A little light on substance, but it's fun and doesn't outstay it's welcome. Following that is another style parody from 'Internet Leaks', 'Skipper Dan', which is another absolute winner. The humor is a little darker than Al is typically known for, being the tale of a talented man who gets sucked into a life of bleak monotony, but that's what makes it so strong in my opinion. Especially since the dark downward spiral of the titular Dan is contrasted with a poppy Weezer riff.  Great stuff, even if you've heard it before.Polka Face is next on the album. This is a hilarious polka mix that really highlights the banality and lack of substance in a lot of today's music. It's hard not to smile at hearing Al gleefully play his accordion while he rips through the likes of Just Bieber, Katy Perry and Ke$ha. Yet another 'Internet leaks' track follows that, 'Craigslist'. This is one of the best tracks of the album for us classic rock fans, or anyone familiar with The Door's famous sound. Al's Morrison impression is superb and hilarious.'Party in the CIA' follows. This might be my favorite song on the album in a lot of ways. It's just so ridiculous. The juxtaposition of Miley's fluff party song's melody and lyrics about assassination and torture just makes me smile for some reason. And laugh. A lot. 'Ringtone' from 'Internet Leaks' follows that. This is an amusing Queen send up; I always felt it was the weakest track from 'Internet Leaks' but that doesn't mean it's bad. The bridge section listing off some of the people who hate the singer's ringtone is still just brilliant.'Another Tattoo' is next. I've never heard the original here, but this song is a delight. For anyone who knows or have even just seen some dude walking down the street, tattoos on even their neck and face, and stopped to wonder what exactly was wrong with them, the song should work well. After that is the lone new original 'If That Isn't Love'. This is my least favorite cut. The humor is a little too juvenile for my tastes. Really, it's pretty disposable.'Whatever you Like' is after that. This was the first song written for the album, but despite that (and unfortunately given the subject matter) it's as timely as ever. It's still a funny track, but if you're an Al fan it really is old news by now. The grand finale is one of the very best songs on the album 'Stop Forwarding This Crap To Me' is patterned off of the compositions of Jim Steinman, famous for penning Meat Loaf's best moments. This song is dynamic and impressive even before you take the hilariously biting lyrics into account. It's impossible to ignore the lyrics though, as they are absolute winners for practically anyone who uses e-mail.Finally, something should be said of the accompanying DVD that comes with the album. This is a little more hit or miss. Some of the videos just have the wrong ideas as to how to capture the song. 'Party In the CIA' would have been better served if it was some cheerful approximation of Miley Cyrus at the focus of the action, rather than the blocky characters the animators uses. 'TMZ's video doesn't work either. It's not funny and more distracts from than it does enhance the song. Most of the 'Internet Leaks' videos hold up much better (especially the perfect Doors spoof 'Craigslist' video). The kinetic typography of the final track is another absolute success, highlighting the smart lyrics and the impressive dynamics of the song.Oh, and the CD cover art is probably the best I've ever seen, for whatever that's worth.",0,0,"Jun 23, 2011"
8,"A very good album, but one that I did not enjoy quite as much as 'Straight Outta Lynwood' a few years ago. Some of the highlights include 'Preform This Way', 'TMZ', 'Craigslist', and the oft-occurring polka medley 'Polka Face'. Other hits on the soundtrack feel more forced, namely 'Party in the CIA'.

The album also contains small skits that are an entertaining interlude between songs.The only cons are that there are songs that will likely fall flat for many listeners, and the entire album itself is very short  for having 18 tracks. There are also songs that Andy was apart of, but it was never made clear that they are lonely island songs, so to hear them on the album seems like a track filler.

The humour is great, but the awesome part of their songs, is that even if you took the humour out of them, you would very cool, very melodic, songs, not just a throw-away tune that is no longer worth it.",0,0,"Jul 30, 2002"
