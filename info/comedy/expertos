AllMusic,90,"It's an album of longing and disquiet. To call any of the songs wistful seems inadequate; they are engulfed in saudade.","Oct 16, 2015"
The 405,90,"The album is riddled with heart-rending affirmations of self-worth.","Oct 16, 2015"
Consequence of Sound,83,"Are You Alone?, as its title suggests, is an incredibly personal experience, one that benefits from conversing with Welsh as much as he is with you.","Oct 16, 2015"
Mojo,80,"The overriding tone recalls Lana Del Rey's gothic torch song elegies, albeit with far more economy and less overacting. [Dec 2015, p.93]","Oct 16, 2015"
No Ripcord,80,"Are You Alone? only reveals itself more dependent upon the listeners own experiences, and since were dealing with heartbreak here, its potent message will never cease.","Oct 16, 2015"
DIY Magazine,80,"A listen that encourages looking inwards and coming to the kind of realisations Welsh himself has poured into the album, a record its impossible not to be swept up by.","Oct 16, 2015"
Pitchfork,80,"Alone is less stripped-down than Impersonator, but it feels less confrontational, too.","Oct 16, 2015"
The Guardian,80,"The overall effect is of a bow-tied cabaret crooner singing to no one: awkwardly intense but, if you steal a glance, completely beguiling.","Oct 16, 2015"
Exclaim,80,"On Are You Alone?, Majical Cloudz are at the height of their powers, opening themselves up fully and inviting the listener in. They sound obsessed, and 'okay' be damned--it feels just right","Oct 16, 2015"
NOW Magazine,80,"Listening is like slowly sinking into a warm bath, then gradually adding rose petals, bubbles, arsenic. But Majical Cloudz never let you drown.","Oct 16, 2015"
Spin,80,"This album should be met on its own terms; its willing to do the same for you.","Oct 16, 2015"
The Line of Best Fit,80,"Majical Cloudz have created a series of crystalline pop songs, which are emotionally direct and powerful; and will surely create a whole new set of subjective responses.","Oct 16, 2015"
Under The Radar,80,"Are You Alone? extends some of the same sounds of Magical Cloudz's debut album, Impersonator, but the music seems stretched and more expansive.","Oct 16, 2015"
Drowned In Sound,80,"If you're not interested in music that makes you feel reflective then perhaps steer clear, otherwise this is a stark, brutally honest exploration of the human psyche that is indeed special.","Oct 16, 2015"
Billboard.com,70,"Its evocative and vivid, recalling early Red House Painters, or even The Blue Nile.","Oct 16, 2015"
Rolling Stone,70,"Taking the voice-and-electronics minimalism of the group's 2013 breakthrough, Impersonator, and stripping it back even further, leaving the vocals alone for a more unmediated delivery. It's an improvement: Welsh has a potent voice.... Bandmate Matthew Otto's shimmering backdrops, meanwhile, have only become more tuneful and inviting.","Oct 16, 2015"
Pretty Much Amazing,67,"There are so many moments when the music seems on the verge of exploding, but never does, and thats ultimately to the albums detriment.","Oct 16, 2015"
Uncut,50,"Are You Alone? hints at a Blue Nile-like melancholy beauty; otherwise the album could be prescribed as a treatment for insomnia. [Dec 2015, p.74]","Oct 16, 2015"

Los Angeles Times,100,"Mandatory Fun is a stone cold masterpiece.","Jul 15, 2014"
The A.V. Club,83,"Despite these missteps ['Sports Song' annd 'Inactive'], the album is a rousing success; its both a smart meta-commentary on pop music and a collection that never takes itself too seriously.","Jul 15, 2014"
AllMusic,80,"Wonders never cease on Mandatory Fun, and neither do the laughs.","Jul 15, 2014"
Punknews.org (Staff),80,"Mandatory Fun is not necessarily among his must-have albums, but it's another solid addition that with satisfy any fan and win over some new kids through these big hit parodies and viral videos.","Jul 15, 2014"
Exclaim,80,"Dollars to donuts, there's not one song or style here that 'Weird Al' doesn't enhance with his sly social commentary or absurdity. All hail the weird king.","Jul 15, 2014"
Paste Magazine,77,"Mandatory Fun is a good, humorous album that shows that Yankovic is not slowing down in the slightest.","Jul 15, 2014"
Billboard.com,76,"The Weird One delivers the reprocessed goods, though it's his original tunes  done in the idiosyncratic styles of his favorite artists--that truly warrant repeat listening.","Jul 15, 2014"
Tiny Mix Tapes,70,"Its impossible to predict which of todays hit songs will become tomorrows classics, but at least Mandatory Fun, Weird Als 14th studio album, delivers on the laughs.","Jul 15, 2014"
Consequence of Sound,67,"Sure, Mandatory Fun is cheap, juvenile, and often downright grating, but damn if it isnt good for a couple of laughs.","Jul 15, 2014"
PopMatters,60,"Mandatory Fun is not his best album (even if it, by far, has his most well-conceived meticulous promotional launch), but it is still very fun, virtually every parody being completely on point and capable of holding up to at least a few replays.","Jul 15, 2014"
Rolling Stone,60,"Sure, theres a touch of hypocrisy in a guy as gloriously tacky as Al taking shots at the shameless but who really cares when its this much fun.","Jul 15, 2014"

Pitchfork,72,"Based on Andy and His Grandmother, Kaufman comes off like an asshole, a hopelessly naive loser, a crazy person, a hothead, a hopelessly sweet grandma's boy, a sexually confused teenager, and a manipulative monster. In other words, he comes off like Andy Kaufman.","Jul 16, 2013"
Exclaim,70,"In his quest for comedic and artistic transcendence, Kaufman's intense pursuit of the 'real' was, at the very least, unwittingly timeless.","Jul 16, 2013"
AllMusic,60,"This is too unfinished and uneven to call a masterpiece, but Kaufman's loyal fan base should still check out this insightful and wonderfully weird experiment.","Jul 16, 2013"
Record Collector,60,"Its all grimly compelling, but you wont be whacking it on at any dinner parties. Unless youre Andy Kaufman.","Jul 16, 2013"
Boston Globe,60,"Undoubtedly one of the strangest albums in recent memory.","Jul 16, 2013"
Consequence of Sound,60,"Its a rare glimpse into Kaufmans methodology--one that will make uninitiated listeners wonder, Arent comedy albums supposed to be funny?","Jul 16, 2013"
Magnet,55,"Those looking for Kaufman's brand of gleefully absurd fin will surely be disappointed, as these tapes are strictly for completist diehards. [No. 101, p.57]","Jul 16, 2013"
PopMatters,50,"The album does get better as it goes along, perhaps as Kaufman got used to the idea of the new technology, but still much of the content is either the start of an idea or what could be considered unfinished business.","Jul 16, 2013"

PopMatters,90,"Its dirty as hell, and youre gonna laugh your ass off.","Jun 11, 2013"
Expert Witness (MSN Music),83,"Struggling for cred as aging rappers will, they stumble occasionally. Some of these ideas obviously seemed funnier when they brainstormed them.","Jun 11, 2013"
The A.V. Club,75,"Even with the occasional duds, The Lonely Islands hits make up for its misses.","Jun 11, 2013"
Absolute Punk (Staff reviews),75,"While their third record The Wack Album may be the groups weakest effort to date, it still shows off their abilities as hook writers and as the preeminent hip-hop satirists in todays industry.","Jun 11, 2013"
Pitchfork,71,"Its silly, its in no shape or form subtle, its fun, it works.","Jun 11, 2013"
Consequence of Sound,70,"While TLI never rival the best of those bygone styles in terms of memorability, this is the first album of theirs to make clear how well theyve grown to understand the dynamics of making rap songs, fake or otherwise, beyond basic song structure.","Jun 11, 2013"
Slant Magazine,70,"Despite its occasional lapses into overly familiar territory, The Wack Album proves there simply isn't anyone out there who executes this strain of musical comedy with as much satirical precision as the Lonely Island.","Jun 11, 2013"
Rolling Stone,70,"Their third LP isn't as sublimely silly, or as consistent [as its last], but it rocks the same mix of guest stars and totally unsophisticated sex jokes.","Jun 11, 2013"
AllMusic,70,"Most impressive about The Wack Album is that The Lonely Island manage to get their jokes across without feeling like they're making fun of rap which, given how much material they'd have by making fun of themselves, would really be a last resort.","Jun 11, 2013"
Paste Magazine,64,"For the most part, its the dirty or profane that plays the best.","Jun 11, 2013"
New Musical Express (NME),60,"Its not Flight Of The Conchords quality but, hey, at least its not The Midnight Beast.","Jun 11, 2013"
Spin,50,"We are offered 20 more, a handful of these tracks bordering on genius, a few offering genuine yuks, and the rest sounding so half-baked they could be an ice-cream flavor.","Jun 11, 2013"
Los Angeles Times,50,"The Wack Album feels awfully short on fresh ideas.","Jun 11, 2013"

PopMatters,80,"No matter how diverse the jokes are, Notaro keeps the flow consistent and doubles you over in laughter. Don't be offended if she seems unaffected, though. It's all just a gimmick.","Aug  8, 2011"
Dusted Magazine,80,"There's a number of visual pieces that lose their power, and while Notaro is good at describing what she's talking about, those visual bits interrupt the flow. In that sense, Good One feels like a straight showcase for her act, one that doesn't make concessions to the audio-only listener.","Aug  8, 2011"
The A.V. Club,75,"At worst, the bits that don't come off on Good One will merely inspire people to spend time with Notaro in person.","Aug  8, 2011"
Consequence of Sound,70,"Where Good One goes wrong is in the selection of jokes. Almost every bit on the album will make you laugh, if not giggle, but so much is lost in the purely audio translation.","Aug  8, 2011"
Under The Radar,70,"Good One never finds Notaro unfunny, just trying too hard. In a world full of lackluster stand-up comedy, there are far worse things.","Aug  8, 2011"
Spin,70,"Her deadpan delivery -- a more extreme version of awkward queen Maria Bamford -- and her truly singular material (how she saved the career of forgotten pop diva Taylor Dayne, an impression of someone doing an impression) don't need silly faces to be hilarious.","Aug  8, 2011"

The A.V. Club,83,"While a parody of a 2008 Taylor Swift song may not sound particularly fresh, Alpocalypse is the most enjoyable collection of Yankovic tunes since 1996's Bad Hair Day.","Jun 21, 2011"
No Ripcord,80,"Alpocalypse is a fine reflection on our world as it stands in this modern age, and well worth a listen, if only for a laugh to brighten up your day.","Jun 21, 2011"
Consequence of Sound,70,"There is no perfect Weird Al album. Each of his records act as a cross section of culture. They become time capsules.","Jun 21, 2011"
American Songwriter,70,"The original songs here are, perhaps surprisingly, stronger than the parodies, and Yankovich shines brightest when he is just being funny without a direct target.","Jun 21, 2011"
AllMusic,70,"Only bummer for loyal fans is that five of these tracks are repeated from the Internet Leaks EP, but ignore that redundancy, and Al remains the undisputed king of the parody song.","Jun 21, 2011"
PopMatters,60,"Alpocalypse may not be his strongest record, but it does what only Weird Al Yankovic can do, and he's been doing for nearly 30 years now, so he must be doing something right.","Jun 21, 2011"
Rolling Stone,50,"The jokes don't always relieve the earworm annoyingness of the Xeroxed tunes. Still, you can only hate so much on an accordion medley titled 'Polka Face.'","Jun 21, 2011"

The A.V. Club,100,"The juxtaposition of white-boy geekiness with swaggering hip-hop posturing forms the core of The Lonely Island's smart-ass take on pop music, but the trio is also distinguished by obsessive cultural specificity on its sophomore effort, Turtleneck & Chain.","May 10, 2011"
Expert Witness (MSN Music),91,"Parody is hard to sustain. That this follow-up provides so many laughs without flailing around in can-you-top-this? is a tribute to the comedians' musicality and their musician friends' sense of comedy.","May 10, 2011"
Okayplayer,85,"The Lonely Island continues to remind us that taking life too seriously isn't nearly as fun as putting bags over our heads during fellatio or shitting our pants during bank robberies.","May 10, 2011"
Los Angeles Times,75,"As on Incredibad, the group's hit 2009 debut, the jokes here work thanks to the seriousness with which they're delivered.","May 10, 2011"
Entertainment Weekly,75,"Now, two years after Incredibad, a debut that collected many of the group's greatest, previously televised hits, comes Turtleneck & Chain, a perfectly acceptibad follow-up.","May 10, 2011"
Pitchfork,71,"An album full of fake rap, famous-people cameos, and scatological jokes shouldn't have any replay value whatsoever, but Turtleneck & Chain holds up awfully well, partly because the music is almost always, at the very least, listenable, and partly because the jokes depend more on earwormy hooks and absurdities spinning out of control than on simple punchlines.","May 10, 2011"
Consequence of Sound,70,"In the end, Turtleneck & Chain ends up being about on par with Incredibad--maybe even a bit better, regardless of the flaws.","May 10, 2011"
AllMusic,70,"Back once again with the ill behavior, Lonely Island's second effort is more of the same, which for many means that life is still worth living.","May 10, 2011"
Rolling Stone,70,"Their consistently great second disc combines songs you've YouTubed to death ('I Just Had Sex,' 'Motherlover') with top-shelf new material featuring good sports from Michael Bolton to Snoop Dogg (they also throw in a DVD of their Web shorts).","May 10, 2011"
New Musical Express (NME),40,"The Saturday Night Live trio pick up where they left off with 2009's Incredibad.","May 10, 2011"

Boston Globe,80,"While memories of the accompanying visuals of the jokes from the series helps, it is by no means strictly necessary to enjoy the humor and musicianship of Freaky.","Oct 20, 2009"
New Musical Express (NME),80,"Even shorn of their comedic context, the best of these tracks still have the power to rupture internal organs at 20 paces.","Oct 20, 2009"
Hot Press,80,"Another dose of brilliant pop parody from the NZ twosome.","Oct 20, 2009"
Prefix Magazine,75,"Im not convinced that the second season, while musically not that adventurous (R&B and hip-hop tracks take up a lot of the disc) doesnt measure up (and occasionally surpass) the heights of season one and the groups self-titled debut.","Oct 20, 2009"
AllMusic,70,"Considering the circumstances, FOTC's second Sub-Pop outing, I Told You I Was Freaky, has some worthwhile moments.","Oct 20, 2009"
Under The Radar,70,"Freaky succeeds not just because it's hysterically funny, but because the songs themselves are authentically good, with hooks and melodies and instrumentation solid enough that you'd go back and listen again even if there were no jokes at all. [Fall 2009, p.58]","Oct 20, 2009"
Alternative Press,70,"The second full-length from the New Zealand duo is pulled almost entirely from the second season of their HBO series, but little is lost in translation. [Nov 2009, p.109]","Oct 20, 2009"
Drowned In Sound,70,"Individual tracks will wax and wane in popularity, and the genitalia humour of 'Sugar Lumps' et al might attract a wider audience who dont understand the deadpan atmosphere of the rest of the show, but its hard to grow tired of this peculiar couple and their music.","Oct 20, 2009"
musicOMH.com,70,"I Told You I Was Freaky is a smart, funny, musically vast album, giving everyone's favorite kiwis a chance to broaden the canvas of their twitchy, awkward, displaced brand of comedy.","Oct 20, 2009"
Pitchfork,67,"The separation anxiety that Freaky induces is its unfortunate undoing, though we can least be glad that someone had the good sense not to include dialogue interludes for context's sake.","Oct 20, 2009"
The A.V. Club,67,"Its antithetical to quibble over issues of originality and cohesion when dealing with song parody, anyway; even when resting on their laurels, the Conchords have a singular ability to pen a damn funny song.","Oct 20, 2009"
The Boston Phoenix,63,"Much like the shows second season, this second disc fails to build on its predecessor, rehashing the same digs at male bravado, emotional insecurity, and musical eccentricity.","Oct 20, 2009"
Rolling Stone,60,"On the second full-length album from this comedy duo, electro beats and white-soul croons bump against jokes about cannibalism and girl troubles--in other words, nothing terribly new for these smart Kiwi guys.","Oct 20, 2009"
The Guardian,60,"If you haven't watched the TV series, what are you supposed to make of Friends, with its weak gag about gay men? Or Petrov, Yelyena, and Me, a gurgling shanty about cannibalism that flounders musically and lyrically? But that's the weaker half of the album; the sublime half works irrespective of prior knowledge.","Oct 20, 2009"
Uncut,60,"The second helping of this sitcom following Flight of the Conchords; Kiwi synth-poppers in New York, was almost as funny as the first, though most critics agreed the songs were weaker.","Oct 20, 2009"
Dot Music,60,"Despite the hilarious wordplay though, it's hard to imagine anyone returning over and over to the actual tunes, you're far better off with a DVD and its accompanying visual gags.","Oct 20, 2009"
Mojo,60,"Like the second series of their HBO sitcom, from which most of the tracks here are culled,...Freaky feels a little rushed, but there's still plenty to love. [Dec 2009, p. 95]","Oct 20, 2009"
Entertainment Weekly,58,"The sophomore studio set by Flight Of The Conchords, which gets off to a disappointing start with a string of lame loverman jokes over even lamer dime-store production. [23 Oct 2009, p.60]","Oct 20, 2009"
Spin,50,"Like most comedy albums, this one loses its luster upon repeated hearings.","Oct 20, 2009"
PopMatters,50,"On I Told You I Was Freaky, the joke often appears to be that theyre performing a certain kind of song (like sing-song-y a cappella or reggae), rather than the songs actual content. Such jokes wear thin quickly, making them novelty songs in the worst sense of the word--amusing when new, tired immediately thereafter.","Oct 20, 2009"
Slant Magazine,50,"The material is better served in context, complete with music videos and framed with dialogue, whereas as a standalone record it misses more than it hits.","Oct 20, 2009"
Paste Magazine,41,"As much of Freaky wallows in the jokes, the record runs out of ideas astonishingly early.","Oct 20, 2009"

MSN Consumer Guide (Robert Christgau),91,"Actual musicians help -- world-beating T-Pain more than world-weary Julian Casablancas. So do other actors.","Feb 10, 2009"
Paste Magazine,86,"The lion's share of Incredibad is without a doubt one of the funniest albums, music or otherwise, in years.","Feb 10, 2009"
AllMusic,80,"It's a hilarious comedy album that's just as hip, inventive, and inappropriate as their digital shorts.","Feb 10, 2009"
Pitchfork,77,"Like their best, 'SNL'-aired material, these songs get better as they go on, mostly because of the way the lyrics carry the joke to its logical and grotesque endpoint.","Feb 10, 2009"
The A.V. Club,75,"TLIs recorded debut, Incredibad, features plenty of Internet- and SNL-tested material--'Dick In A Box,' 'Natalies Rap,' 'Jizz In My Pants,' and 'Im On A Boat'--which actually holds up well on physical media.","Feb 10, 2009"
Billboard,70,"Not every track is equally gut-busting, and a few, like the poseur reggae tune 'Ras Trent,' are made much funnier by the included video. But the Lonely Island has certainly found its bearings.","Feb 10, 2009"
The New York Times,70,"The only place this collection falls flat is in its inclusion of some pre-'SNL' Lonely Island material. Its funny, but no-fi and awkward.","Feb 10, 2009"
Hartford Courant,70,"Off-kilter humor is a trademark of Samberg's, though, and while most of the songs here won't have much staying power, they're funny enough right now.","Feb 10, 2009"
Under The Radar,70,"Sometimes the music is played intentionally bad, but for the most part, the music is played straight-up and holds surprisingly well after many listens. [Spring 2009, p.72]","Feb 10, 2009"
Rolling Stone,60,"Some punch lines feel left over from the dial-up era (is anyone still 'doing the Bartman'?), but 'Like a Boss' is a Dirty South anthem that's absurd enough for Lil Wayne. Meet the new frontier of White and Nerdy.","Feb 10, 2009"
New Musical Express (NME),60,"This one fares better than most in audio form, but whether Natalies Rap will be enjoyed by anyone who hasnt already wet themselves at the video is debatable.","Feb 10, 2009"
Prefix Magazine,50,"Lonely Island are among the funniest musical comedians around. But without video, their songs are more 'A Night at the Roxbury' than 'Waynes World.'","Feb 10, 2009"
PopMatters,40,"Theres a certain pleasure in watching celebrities like Justin Timberlake, Natalie Portman, or T-Pain take the piss out of themselves. Unfortunately, this is largely drained when youre listening to the songs sans-video.","Feb 10, 2009"
Uncut,40,"American show 'Saturday Night Live' has a tradition of creating comedy heroes we don't quite get in the UK. Alongside Adam Sandler and Will Ferrell we can add The Lonely Island--essentially Flight Of The Conchords with more sperm jokes. [May 2009, p.91]","Feb 10, 2009"
