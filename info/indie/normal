The who's who of indie is present on a record that mixes excellent songwriting with sharp production and is well worth getting hold of. What goes against the record slightly is the number of different collaborations. This tends to take away for the continuity of the album. For example we get a trio of rock numbers in Little Girl, Angel's Harp and Pain in the middle of an otherwise very laid back and chilled out record. These songs kind of come out of nowhere and disappear again. I will say that I did come to the record expecting a little bit more but  the record is nothing if not interesting and I'd recommend it to anyone into either Dangermouse or Sparklehorse.",0,0,"Jan  3, 2014"

They've lost their edge and, for me, have shed nearly everything that made them interesting. Antidotes was my album of the year two years ago. This doesn't get near my top 20 for 2010. As soon as I heard the pained, whiny vocals on Spanish Sahara, and the excruciatingly slow build up that accompanies it, I knew that was it. Some decent moments. I like 'This Orient', yet even that song outstays it's welcome by repeating the chorus one too many times. Ultimately just not very interesting.",1,2,"Dec  1, 2010"

5,"This album is patchy. There are some really lovely bits, particularly the first 30 seconds of many of the songs, but then it gets spoiled by some 'trying-too-hard' and constipated vocals and awkward arrangements. I think they are trying to be a blend of talking heads, radiohead and dirty projectors, but are not anywhere near as good or original as any of those.  6/10 is generous. With XX, probably the most over-rated album of the year and I have not once managed to sit through the entire Foals album.",0,2,"Aug 12, 2010"
8,"Excellent second album from one of the class acts of recent years. 'Total Life Forever' is a more complex and substantial piece of work than 'ANTIDOTES' and we really hear a development in the band's sound and ambition as well. The songwriting is much braver than on their debut and the band seem more confident and clear in what they want to achieve. Foals create a pretty dark and moody vibe throughout the album but its not really a downbeat album bar a few numbers. This album is consistent throughout, therefore it is really difficult to pick out highlights. Each tracks flows into the next quite seamlessly.

The riffs are **** and simplistic, the vocals are uninteresting and stupidly affected, the drum-machine is thrown in to create the sparse, urgent sound people are cumming over. The emphasis on the drums and the aggressive repetitive riffs get some people off apparently. Yes, it is different.

Your fellow students absolutely LOVE the team, and get completely into the cheers and games and yell and scream as loud as they can (that'd be the guitars). And to add accents to it all, there's those smaller events that occur all the time, as well as the actual game. Any contact made, and big change in someone's life, a breakup maybe, a new spark, a fight, whatever. Those would be the drums.

You can see Treats as 'merely' making ultra low bass and rap metal safe for indie kids, or 'simply' marketing Shellac to pre-teens, but then again, think of how brilliant/ingenious *you'd* have to be to actually make that happen. Sometimes Sleigh Bells pastiches and re-contextualizes so much -- I mean, they really seem to flat out lift riffs in some places -- Cure, Pixies, My Bloody Valentine -- when they don't sample, that I almost think of them as a parallel universe rock version of Girl Talk.

She also tries some more pop friendly sounds with 'Hollywood' and 'Oh No!' and she does it very well. It's not a perfect album, it has some flaws, but it is very solid, and more importantly, very intelligent. It is a shame that she didn't make it big, but she wasn't so mainstream after all.

So: I'm happy LCD Soundsystem pulled through with their third album not only because of its quality--lyrically, musically, and in regards to its production--but because it connects so well to me and gives me an urge to dance and be all alive-like.

9,"Favourite Songs: Dance Yrself Clean, Drunk Girls, One Touch, I Can Change, You Wanted A Hit
Least Favourite Songs: Somebody's Calling Me
Since LCD Soundsystem are getting back together I think it's only fitting that I celebrate by revisiting their last LP 'This Is Happening' to remind myself how great the band were because they were amazing and after listening to this album I think anyone would find it hard to disagree. Although James Murphy might claim to not know how to make a hit I think nearly every song on here stands strongly on their own as a hit, especially songs like 'I Can Change' and 'Drunk Girls' which feel just as familiar at this point as any Beatles record- the ones you discover and feel like you've known for years. I'm not suggesting that LCD Soundsystem will become ingrained into culture like The Beatles, that would be ridiculous they're nowhere near as big but at the moment they do have a certain familiarity to their music, in my opinion anyway. This is the best electronic/dance album I've heard this decade for two reasons. Firstly, Murphy's lyrics are loveably awkward and very self aware. Secondly, the band don't tie themselves down with song structures, they really let the songs spiral out over however long it takes for them to be properly explored (the only kind of radio-friendly track is 'Drunk Girls' at about 4 minutes) leading to a lot of really fun progressive dance tracks that aren't afraid to take some risks, although a risk I've always been on the line with is their choice of a really out of tune noise over the top of some extremely simple piano chords on 'Somebody's Calling Me'. It works for me sometimes if I don't think too much, it's just a track I think could have been cut down as it doesn't really go into any exciting or particularly fun territory. That's really my only complaint about this album though. That and the track order. Apart from that it's damn near perfect. Can't wait for their new album.

10,"This album is Maroon 5 on LSD. and I love it. lots of shots are fired, and although many of them miss the mark, the moments of brilliance are well worth wading through the interstitial, often cluttered, but usually thoughtful r&b/acid grooviness. the mood ofcompass shifts from neurotic and dark acid funk to elated church-soul, ultimately painting Lidell's complicated psychology. The highs portray an almost campy exhuberance while the lows are as dense and complex as the many devices he uses to modify and deconstruct his clearly virtuosic voice. indeed,as Lidell croons 'we dont need no armor for protection', the listener is reminded that there are few pretenses in the way of the vision Lidell seeks to convey, or rather, unapologetically confesses. above all, the beat, when, although intermitently, firmly in place, carries us through some very catch hooks and funk **** the album is definitely worth investing some time into, as I'm sure every listener will be able to take something worthwhile away from the wide and varied catalog of songs that compass has to offer.",0,0,"Aug 29, 2010"
8,"In 2010, Jamie Lidell found a new direction.  And it was appropriately called Compass.  Representing a perfect blend of all the styles hed employed in his career to date, the album paints a thick, gritty picture from the outset.  Opener Completely Exposed begins with Lidell singing over a heavily affected beat-box before the grimey, lurching track drops in, featuring some kind of sampled riff that sounds like a saw-player picked up a two-by-four on accident.  Lidell intones I dont wanna be closed, but opening up has left me completely exposed.  Whether the lyric references his new-found fame, or his production collaborations on the record (including Beck, Grizzly Bears Chris Taylor, Lindsey Rome, Robbie Lackritz), the vulnerability seems to be doing him some good.  Your Sweet Boom follows, an exceptional song in concept and execution, even managing to employ a pitched-down verse vocal and still maintain emotional substance (that is some kind of feat, let me tell you).  As Lidell sings We dont need no armor for protection, the recurring theme of vulnerability is overtaken by a rallying of the troops, swept up in a swell of shimmering synths and ascending vocals.
The pacing on the album is diplomatic, spreading the highs and lows evenly throughout, and while it makes for a distributed listening experience, I feel like some of the tracks could have been repositioned.  She Needs Me, while a compelling slow jam in its own right, totally wastes the momentum built by Your Sweet Boom.  Fortunately I Wanna Be Your Telephone rebounds quickly with a blip-bloopy boogie and sampled scenery, followed by Enough Is Enough, a gem of a tune that sounds like a young Stevie Wonder revving up the Sesame Street block party.  The stomp-clap heave of The Ring features another unrecognizable sound (vocal? guitar?) squeezing out a squirmy, dusty riff.  Its one of many examples of the truly unique and captivating textures Lidell creates on Compass, often allowing him to prop up potentially bland melodic moments with sonic intrigue.
Another album highlight arrives with the twelfth track, Coma Chameleon, which serves as an example of everything Lidell does best.  The huge, Zeppelin-esque drum intro gives way to Rhythm Nation-style churchbell hits.  The understated chorus creeps along an eighth-note bounce with horn chops and a devious earworm hook:  Coma chameleon  If you ever wake up you will see what you have done.  The song is a stylistic achievement, simultaneously showcasing Lidells studio creativity, vocal panache, and songwriting ability  elements that are present all throughout Compass, but dont consistently enjoy perfect alignment like they do here.
Ultimately, Compass isnt a perfect record, but it is a bold statement.  Having tried his hand at genre-homage, Lidell seems to have found the blueprint for an effective marriage of his electro-producer past and blue-eyed soul frontman present.  The results are compelling and boast gobs of potential.  Heres to hoping Lidell shares my view of Compass as a singular success, and moreover, continues down this trail that he is truly blazing all on his soulful lonesome.",0,0,"May 10, 2013"
9,"A lovely album. I guess it could be classed as Americana or Alternative Country. Although I'm not a fan of either of those genres, I do really like this record. The lyrics are great, the tunes are excellent and it has a very consistent feel to it throughout. The records creates an atmosphere that really takes you away and I could see myself listening to this while sitting on a back porch of a house somewhere in the American Deep South overlooking a swamp. That's probably not what Matthew Houck was going for with this record but that what it for me and I like it. It's hard to pick a stand out track as it's all pretty good stuff.

What Tiny Mix Tapes pointed as lackluster songwriting was, well, when you trying to confront cloying and belligerent excess head to head, what you get is a malformed, clamorous mess. I just happen to enjoy they way they pull it off. But the rampant comparison to Loveless got a bit out of hand; have you ever heard of Medicine by the way?

10,"As I enter my fifth decade of passionate love for rock and all of its variations, I notice myself buying fewer and fewer albums--not less music but fewer complete CDs.  BJM is one of a handful of bands that makes albums, rather than mere collections of songs, and 'Who Killed Sgt. Pepper' is a perfect example.  Yes, there's a lot of variety, as the professional critics point out, but there's also a kind of conversation among the various songs.  To cite just one example, different songs take different approaches to questions about the role of language in music: what is the relationship of sound to sense, for example?  One song repeats a crude, perfectly clear phrase over and over ('Let's Go **** Mental'); in the next, a woman's echoing voice speaks so unintelligibly that it's impossible to tell what language she's speaking, never mind what she's saying ('White Music'); the third lays an incantatory Icelandic vocal over a smoking, bass-heavy groove ('This Is Your Last Warning').  It's nothing so schematic as a thesis-antithesis-synthesis progression, but, rather, a series of experiments that build on one another to sketch a range of possibilities for language in rock.  Unusually ambitious and very cool.  All of which is not to say that 'Who Killed...' doesn't also feature great songs that can stand on their own; it does.  Anton Newcomb has regularly delivered killer rock tunes, and 'Mental,' 'Someplace Else Unknown,' 'Tunger Hnifur' and 'Feel It' stack up well to earlier stand-outs.  But the band is not just rehashing earlier successes; like the 'dance' songs on the album, the rock tunes have a smoldering new edge, with louder, dirtier drums and bass than I ever would have expected from BJM.  In short, I love this record and its contradictions: its chaos and its sophisticated unities; its grinding sexuality and its intellectual reach.  I expect to keep buying BJM's albums, in their entirety, for many years to come.",1,1,"Feb  6, 2012"

8,"I picked this album up strictly off of the strength of the Symphonies remix with Kid Cudi.  That song is an anthem, it is near perfect, however the rest of the album is more of a mized bag.  His vocals are reminiscent of Passion Pit, Mika, and other indie, rock, pop falsetto voices.  the problem however lies not as much with his unique vocala nd th elimitations that leads to, but with the all over the place vibe of the music itself.  He suppoedly produced and created all the sounds himself, which i give props for, however the album is not cohesive in sound, theme, or tone.  It is best when the sound is glossy dreamy electro pop and dance beats, however his slower tracks once again, like a lot of modern day music, just does not resonate.  Just because you are making a pop album does not mean you need to do cheezy, unemotional slow songs and ballads.  A slow song needs drive, it needs to be personal and emotional not just follow the formula syrup and mush, blah.
However I give extra props for the self production sounding so full and lush and the overall vibe of the album is futuristic, hopeful, angsty, and fun.  i look forward to more music from Dan Black, a tour featuring him, Robyn and Mika would be amazing!!!",0,0,"Nov 18, 2010"

8,"There they are, Mumford & Sons. The band I've come to (lovingly) refer to as either folk-pop-rock or pop-folk-rock. It's the best label for this band and their 2 albums. Sigh No More & especially the song 'The Cave' exploded this band into, pretty much, worldwide-fame. A thing which breeds hatred in the elitist hipster circles of anything 'Indie'. So bashing is expected with anything they will do & did from this album on.
But here's a shocker for those people.. It's a great album! They will laugh at that of course, and call them  possibly me) names, to afterwards go back to their thumbs-up-asses circle-jerk over 'real' (indie)folk bands. Until those get popular of course.
Why is that important to put in front of my review? Because once you realize how that elitist wannabe-intellectual driven part of the music world works, you'll know how to spot & filter it from the 'general opinion'.
Now onto the actual review.
Sigh No More starts slow & gentle, lamenting over sparse guitar accompaniment. Until about half-way through it becomes an upbeat statement on love, repeated lyrics with building up music. It's a great starter, and will get the feel of the album started.
Let's be real.. everyone knows The Cave. That song was a complete summer hit. And rightfully so, it's got the vibe that fits sunny weather. That may sound odd, but those weird little things are important to me. I don't listen to a song if the 'vibe' isn't right. And the Cave (Mumford & Sons in general) and sunny weather go hand in hand.
It truly is a great song.
Winter Winds, ironically, is also a very warm and 'sunny' song. Picture a sunny day in early Fall.. such an image goes perfectly with this song. Granted that you don't live in a lifeless place, in that case 'point missed'.
White Blank Pages is a song of lamenting love, with increasing accompaniment & harmonization. It moves the album to a more minor sound. It's a very good song,
I Gave You All, the first of the 3 darker songs on the album. It's pure heartbreak & searching for as to why it came to that point. Towards the end it  treads lightly into the land of rock. This song is one of the highlights of the album.
Little Lion Man is another very well known song from this album. It's not really a favorite of mine, but it's a good song.
Timshel is the gentlest song on the album. It's stays soft during the entire song. It appears to be a song of support, of comfort. 'You are not alone in this'.
Thistle & Weeds is one of my favorites. It's a song heavy in metaphor, and alludes to two persons who deal with some form of trauma. But where one seems to have abandoned all, the other picks up the pieces of him & himself. It's very atmospheric.
Awake My Soul is kind of gospel-folk with an anthemic build-up. It works, it sounds very good. Can't say it's a favorite, but it a good song.
Dust Bowl Dance is an atmospheric revenge tale, that also alludes to the Grapes of Wrath. It goes into full on rock territory as the song progresses. It's an absolute favorite.
After the Storm is another favorite! It's slowed down & sounding very open. Filling the space with Marcus's vocals & some sparse guitars, and later in the song increasing accompaniment of ambient strings & accordion, and soft (well placed) hits on the toms. It's a very 'soaring' song, despite it's slow tempo.
It's a great album, it really is. If you like anything that ranges from rock, folk, singer-songwriters or generally have a wide taste in music, you should definitely give it a show. I would give it an ~8.5/10 but that's not possible here, so I'll stick to 8/10.",1,1,"Sep 21, 2013"
10,"Absolutely amazing music.  I just discovered them a week ago and can't stop listening to them.  The lyrics are well done, with an intelligent feel to them.",7,8,"Dec  6, 2010"
3,"I'm sorry but I've gotta go along with Pitchfork on this one. It has one song that sticks, I guess for lyrical/personal/whatever reasons. ('I Gave You All.' I freakin' love that song.) But the aesthetic from one song to the next is *identical.*I'm not saying that they don't have a certain knack for building up the tempo to a cacophony and letting Marcus Mumford's voice ride the instruments like a wave. They're not half bad at it. But they aren't exactly the best there's ever been, yet they do it on EVERY SONG. On a contemporary level, Arcade Fire and The Decemberists easily have them beat at that. What makes those bands as good as they are (or great, in Arcade Fire's case) is that they don't copy this formula on every song. They show off their wealth of other talents.When you can do something pretty-well-but-not-great, as M&S do with their folk anthemic climaxes, you should think about switching it up and writing a new song once in a while. And P4k, I'm sad to say, is spot on. When every song has the exact same formula, the album as a whole starts to sound disingenuous and I become totally disconnected with it. Imagine if Fleet Foxes had used the wordless chorus-double verse-A Capella 3-4-part harmonies on EVERY song on Sun Giant as they did with Mykonos. It would've been horrible, and a real slight to the genre of folk rock.I'm not going to say that this isn't a good band. (Yet.) If they could chill on the soft-loud formula like some sort of folk rock Nirvana, maybe use it on one or two songs in an album, and use the rest of the space for--I dunno--something else, I can hear what they're made of.",7,10,"May 23, 2011"

2,"The point of the Pitchfork review is that this record sounds completely contrived. They give you harmonies a la Fleet Foxes, but it feels forced, not natural. They basically sound like what every band at your crappy local Irish pub is trying to be. Unfortunately, even with success in their efforts, it comes across as an incongruous pastiche of tacky musical tricks. They might have sounded good at one time or another, but here they're smooshed together without an ounce of creativity or musical adventurism. They don't challenge the listener in the slightest nor do they break any musical ground.

A dramatic air of country, bluegrass, folk and even celta is breathed with gladness, though I would say the first half of the record owns the best aroma, in particular the track 'I gave you all', with an expectant intro and stunning ending.

One of my favourite albums of all time. Marcus Mumford's voice is truly unique and he infuses each and every song with incredible passions whether it be on the more upbeat songs such as 'The Cave' or 'Little Lion Man' or the dramatic 'Thistle and Weeds'.

The lyrics feel like they actually have meaning and depth, very much unlike the repetitive boring garbage they release on the charts nowadays. This is REAL music, makes me proud to be British. The tune in every song is extremely powerful. My personal favourites are Little Lion Man, The Cave, Roll Away Your Stone and Hold On To What You Believe. I've constantly tried to find a folk band that can even parallel this band. I've failed. The choruses in every song feel so powerful, and there is real emotion and thought put into every word, every chord. Every single thing I've ever wanted from music has been given to me by this beautiful album, which if you think very hard and listen to all the songs in order, actually tells a well-crafted story. A timeless marvel.",0,0,"Jun 29, 2015"
3,"I came into Life Is Sweet! expecting a lot. I'd seen the video for Marlene: the song was catchy. Lightspeed Champion's previous album to this day remains one of my favourite albums. But I was sorely disappointed.Life is Sweet! lacks the thing that made Lavender Bridge great: identity. Lavender Bridge was unique. While it had obvious influences, they all combined to form a greater whole, and a being that transcended influences to become a beast of its own. This album throws that identity out, in favour of variety as it swings between western to pop-rock to piano-led ballads to small classical-inspired instrumentals, and through this mechnical genre-running removes the raw emotion and humanity that Lavender had in spades.But, taken on its own merits, is Life Is Sweet! still a good album? The answer is possibly. While none of the songs are 'bad' per se, instrumentation is occasionally incongruous with the song it's in, repetition is featured highly but of the annoying parts of the songs, and as a complete album it is far too unfocused and dithering. Sweetheart is the best representation of the album as a whole: the song begins with an acoustic guitar, breaking tension with a bass guitar and swelling vocals in the chorus and showing fantastic amounts of potential - then it breaks its mood, momentum and quality as it breaks into a western, nearly hoe-down sounding refrain with Dev whining an annoying melody. Life Is Sweet! definitely had potential, but is overall disappointing - both standing alone, and as the follow-up to Lavender Bridge.",0,0,"Mar 30, 2011"
10,"This album is criminally underrated.  Almost every song on Minor Love is a gem. Adam Green has matured both emotionally and musically with this album, and after a bunch of releases in recent years that didn't live up to his early work, critics failed to notice he's suddenly put out one of the greatest records of 2010.  There is unmistakable newfound depth & sincerity enshrouded in these songs, which can easily be overlooked by a critic who is too lazy to look beneath the irony that adam has been known for. It is perhaps that uncomfortable juxtaposition of hyper-nonsense with hyper-sincerity that makes this so touching. Not to mention, these songs are short and catchy-as-hell with melodies and arrangements that aren't obvious. There is nothing trendy or too earth-shatteringly original about this album, and there doesn't need to be-- these songs stand on their own.",0,0,"Jan  6, 2011"

Local Natives not only incorporate mind-blowing texture and comfortable harmonies, but they take you to places you never knew even existed. The kick-off 'Wide Eyes' smashes any doubt that this record might not be worth listening to, followed by the killer  single 'Airplanes'. Fan favorite, and traditional closer song 'Sun Hands' leads in to the optimistic 'World News' and the ride only gets better from there. By the time the listener hits 'Who Knows, Who Cares', they have most likely realized that this band is different from the many that exist in this day and age. One of the only albums I can listen to all the way through and be sad when it ends, you'll almost wish that it was longer",0,0,"Apr 24, 2013"
9,"Local Natives' debut album, Gorilla Manor, is a grandiose album, containing the perfect amount of emotion, soaring melodies, and perfectly constructed instrumentals that a good indie album should contain. The opening song, 'Wide Eyes', is the perfect song to begin the record with, as it sets the tone of the entire album. The catchy riff and melody leave nothing to be desired indeed. 'Airplanes' is a feel-good song with exceptional piano, drums, and vocals. Then again, the vocals are notably performed throughout the entire album. 'Sun Hands' is the most rock-inspired song on the album due to its harsher vocals and faster rhythm.  'World News' is one of my favorite songs of the album because of its highly catchy guitar parts and ambitious vocals. The next four songs are some of my least favorite of the album, but offer good vibes nonetheless. Of these four, 'Camera Talk' is definitely my favorite. The ninth song on the album, 'Who Knows Who Cares,' is my favorite song on the record. The calm and memorable guitar riff, the emotional pop vocals, the ascending intensity of the song, and the intense drum interlude all combine to create a majestic specimen of indie-pop. The last three songs really put a great end to the album. 'Cubism Dream' carries some surprisingly powerful musical momentum that is satisfyingly released at the end of the song. 'Stranger Things' incorporates a very pleasing strings section and contains one of my favorite verse melodies of the album. The somewhat calm nature of the last song, 'Sticky Thread,' brings the album to a very satisfactory close that really makes you think, 'Wow, that was a damn good record.' Overall, Gorilla Manor is one of my favorite albums and has placed the Local Natives high on my list of favorite bands.",0,0,"Jul 31, 2013"

Vampire Weekend's debut was of a style so fresh, simple and absorbing it couldn't help but collect masses of praise from critics and fans alike, yet they've somehow weighed themselves down in this second outing. Opener 'Horchata' and lead single 'Cousins' are full of such dizzying synth or percussion hooks you almost feel nauseous listening to them, while 'White Sky' is an uninspiring rip-off of Paul Simon's Graceland. The one high point on the album is 'Taxi Cab', which is actually one of the best tracks the band have ever written and the only example of them being able to replicate the beautiful harmony and delicacy of their debut while simultaneously being a change of style. The rest of the album sounds hideously like a Vampire Weekend tribute group that just don't get the sound.",0,1,"Oct  2, 2010"

9,"Vampire Weekend's debut album is a tough act to follow, so c'mon, cut these Ivy League boys some slack. Although nothing from 'Contra' gobsmacks you with the same immediacy as 'I Stand Corrected' and 'Oxford Comma', a backlash is unwarranted. If anything, the songs, this time around, are better arranged, which almost makes up for the disappointing tunesmanship. 'Giving Up the Gun', with its percussive backing track, gives minimalism a good name, just like Prince did during his glory years(disc one of 'Sign of the Times', and 'Kiss'(from 'Parade')), and more importantly, the one track that would've been at home on the band's superlative debut. There's other highlights, albeit only for fans with realistic expectations. The lead singer sounds like a collegiate Paul Simon on 'Taxi Cab', had 'Graceland' been recorded at the beginning of the old folkie's career. 'Run', and especially 'Horchata', while not pure songs(any garage band could cover 'A-Punk' and sound great), indie-rock songs that transcend its sometimes limiting aesthetic, the African-flavored percussions and baroque instrumentation adorn the two 'Contra' tracks with a lot of textural detail; they're busy songs that give the listener something to unpack. 'This ain't no [sophmore slump]/this ain't no fooling around'.

How Contra differs is that it has much more depth than the debut, with the final three songs being so much greater than the sum of their parts. I really see it being very close to infallible, as there really isn't anything notable I can find to criticise...

10,"Here's the thing: I didn't really like their first album all that much.  'Oxford Comma' was nice and all, but the rest of the album was just a bit twee and insubstantial for my tastes.  What makes Contra such a great record is that it packs much more of an instrumental punch than it's predecessor, while deftly maintaining everything that people love (and hate) about Vampire Weekend.  It's smarter, too: whereas the self-titled seemed naive and precious - and thus a wide-open target for it's legions of critics - Contra, on the other hand, seems proudly defiant.  Tracks such as 'Horchata' and 'Holiday' encapsulate everything haters love to spout about, but this only contributes to the fact that these songs are, in fact, catchy as hell and extremely well done, as is the rest of the album.Over all, an enormous improvement over their so-so debut, and one that is capable of both nuance and the blissed-out excitement that put them on the map in the first place.",0,0,"Jan  7, 2012"
8,"Contra doesnt completely manage to worthily follow up their surprisingly good debut, but is really close to their self-titled first release two years ago. The New York indie band has maintained their nebulous lyrics and experimental music style that takes reggae, ska, baroque, Afrobeat, and so many other weird types of music that most likely arent even named, and throws them all into one single song. This definitely needs getting used to, but if youve listened to Vampire Weekend before (which if you havent done, youve really missed an important new band), then you should be accustomed to their unconventional kind of music and should have great fun with this CD straightaway. Just like Oasis, Arctic Monkeys, or so many other popular alternative rock bands out there, the band members oftentimes arent sure about their songs meanings themselves which gives the listener dozens of interpretations on the 10 songs that Contra offers us. The phrasing is intelligent plus lovely to hear and the four guys are totally personable. Therefore, just like with their entrance in the big music business, Contra isnt a real musical masterpiece, yet an endearing album that you will think about a lot and will immediately want on your iPod. After all, its only contra is that most tracks just arent as catchy as the songs on Vampire Weekend.",0,0,"Jun 19, 2013"

9,"[9.3] Contra has a lot of things that Vampire Weekend clearly wants, and clearly recognizes that they didn't have them before. Their debut was self-admittedly pure fun, and while the songwriting was smart, catchy, and generally accessible, it was clearly an exhibition of influence. They wanted very much to get right in your face, and tell you 'look at what we know.' There is certainly no problem with having influences, but with their debut, they didn't have the right attitude to support their ideas. They wanted to have fun, and more importantly, they wanted other people to have fun. They didn't make music for themselves, which is generally the undoing of many great bands. Contra is a an experiment of self-realization, and it has a whole f*cking lot of character to realize. Their influences are absolutely still there, but now they actually know how to use them. Instead of just saying 'look at what I know,' they say, 'look at what I know, and look at how I'm using it.' Now their influences have purpose, they use fun, generally not well-known African pop beats and show how they can be beautiful, rather than just fun. The result is great, and sometimes even nostalgic. One might get the feeling of driving on a tropical island listening to some eccentric Afro-beat, which is almost reminiscent of some video games (or specifically, Far Cry). The sound is distinct, instantly recognizable, and greatly rewarding. While it isn't a reflective album, it doesn't need to be. It's an album about growth (themed appropriately), and most importantly, self-satisfaction. Vampire Weekend passes the test that all new bands struggle with and usually can't figure out. They know what their place is, and they don't care what their audience thinks it is because they don't have to, and they know that.",0,0,"Nov  2, 2013"

Contra, at it's time in 2010, was a highly anticipated album that some say had too much hype than it should have gotten. To be honest, I agree. There are some tracks on this album that I absolutely loved, (Take Diplomat's Son, and 'Cousins'), and some that were so-so. To be honest, I only like about half of the track son this record, the others grew on me. I'm giving them credit for building on their own sound, and again, I really really love some of these tracks, however, that's only half the package.
It just never grew on me. 6/10",0,0,"Apr 29, 2013"

8,"This is one of the most unique albums I've heard in recent memory. Maybe even of all time. How an album this adventurous reaches #1 on Billboard is a mystery.
Apparently Contra refers to four things. On the surface, this record's about a breakup. On top of that, he's added stuff about an 80s videogame called 'Contra', Nicaraguan politics, and an album by the Clash called Sandinista! that he quotes and references several times throughout. What the  I don't give a  about Nicaragua, old videogames, or the unsatisfying follow-up to London Calling. Why would you load your album with all that?
But that hardly matters. What I get from this is some guy who's been into all of these things recently and needed to put them all under one umbrella, using the word Contra to bring them together. I can't blame him for that; he's just writing about what he knows. In fact, his mind jumping around random subjects makes the central part of this  the breakup aspect  a lot stronger. It seems counterintuitive considering the other stuff would DETRACT from that, but to me it doesn't. The last track, the only one without all the Clash/Nicaragua/videogame bull****, is incredibly satisfying whereas in any other setting it would be a blowoff of a breakup song.
Now this is definitely a departure from Vampire Weekend's self-titled debut, but that's a good thing. I liked a lot from that, but it's not too revisitable. Fortunately, improvements have been made in the right places. The falsetto has been laid off except on the last track, where it fits. There is little to no filler on here. The incomprehensible lyrics are still incomprehensible, but actually do flow with one another.
You're a pretentious band, but that's what you do. You've done absolutely everything to improve on your last record.
I give this an eight out of ten, almost a nine, but not quite one. I hoped it would be higher considering all the great stuff I've been hearing. But it's good enough, and a must-listen for anyone.

It is the perfect follow-up to 'Vampire Weekend', the band's first album, and it contains many of the things which made it marvellous, but with different flavours and a wider array of influences, such as classical, synthpop, ska, and reggae. The songs are all at the standard Vampire Weekend calibre, and that is an amazing feat in itself.

9,"Where 'Oh No' was a dramatic improvement over their Eponymous first album, it still contained the same pop-flavored playfulness. 'Of the Color of the Blue Sky', though, takes a huge composition and genre leap into new frontiers for the band.At first glance, this album didn't grab me. But as most 'evolutionary' albums go, it takes a few listens to really grasp what the band is attempting. The song that kept be coming back was 'This Too Shall Pass', along with (of course) the incredible Rube Goldberg machine video. However, the rest of the album quickly grew on me to the point that I was amazed at the incredible collection of songs.Kulash's ever-increasing use of a falsetto is a little distracting at times because, let's face it, he doesn't have the strongest voice. But it does lend character to some of the songs. 'Wtf?' certainly benefits from it as it balances out its great, funky deep rhythm, as does 'Skyscrapers' and the practical primal scream as the song progresses.The elements that are most impressive are the increased sophistication of both lyrics and composition. The band has definitely tried to evolve and grow their sound, which in my opinion is vital for any band to have any staying power. In doing so, they augment their penchant for catchy riffs with some introspective subjects and an increased sonic landscape.What would be interesting is to see this band produced by someone that creates a deeper soundscape the way Brian Eno does for Coldplay. Sometimes the flatness and distortion of the production on this album makes it feel more like a demo record than a final product.",1,1,"Mar  6, 2012"

This is become increasingly evident in The Strokes' new music, where it seems like they just want to change their style completely unnecessarily. They don't care how it sounds, they just care that they're putting out music. After listening to this album, it's quite clear that Julian is the main problem with the band's lack of cohesion and consistency. When I listen to this and Comedown Machine (which I enjoyed despite its poor songwriting), all I hear is an artist that can't wait to stop writing music. Much to his own fault, his music lacks the enthusiasm and the sincerity to entertain me like the first two Strokes albums did.

Every song is pure poetry, and some songs like 'Glass' or '11th Dimension' could be multiple poems if separated correctly. This album is clearly underrated and continues with the trend of mine 'I have never bought an album Julian Casablancas was involved in that I didn't like.' I listen to this music almost daily, and if not, it's at least on my mind all the time. I will always keep a CD copy of this in my car, and in my home. I burn CD's of this album to share with my friends so they can enjoy it. And it only gets better. If you look on youtube there are acoustic versions of '11th Dimension', 'River of Breaklights', and '4 Chords of the Apocalypse' that are PHENOMENAL!

7,"The Temper Trap have produced a, to put it bluntly, 'good' album. There were three tracks on this album that  stood out for me 'Sweet Disposition', 'Fader', and 'Love Lost'. These three outstanding tracks saved the album from a negative review- they are excellent. Each with a different feel, they all showcase the best of Australia's music. In particular, Sweet Disposition, I believe, is the best song by an Australian artist of the decade. This track is worth 16.99 itself, or however much Itunes charges for the album. However, the album has a shocking consistency. It is filled with let-downs. Apart from the aforementioned three songs, this album has nothing. The only reason this album scored so well is due to the simple fact that it has three songs which pull it through, and make the album a worthwhile buy.",0,0,"Mar 14, 2011"

Additional better musical investments from 2009 are Girls - Album and Dirty Projectors - Bitte Orca.

The best thing about this band are that they have a unique and distinctive style and have brought something new to the market. Received great reviews in general, I have to agree for the most part. Only thing I would like is a little more variation in the songs and perhaps a couple of more quicker paced tunes. The last third of the record goes at a crawling pace. Having said that the consistent style across the album is probably one of the main things that make it all sound so well put together and well thought out.

In some songs, yes, but not everywhere. The lyrics are nothing special and especially the woman's voice was importunate to me.

From its headbanging yet thoughtful opener 'Careful' to the highlight of the album and one of the band's most memorable hits, 'Ignorance', to the top 40 tailored yet honest 'The Only Exception' to its dramatic ending ballad 'All I Wanted' which is strangely similar to that of Kelly Clarkson's Breakaway era, Brand New Eyes is a charming third studio effort that's charming and although it doesn't reach new ground, it's overall a success.",1,1,"Oct 13, 2013"

And yet the maturity of Williams' vocals and songwriting is highly noticeable, as well as the band's performance overall. 'Careful' is a rocking, yet emotional jumpstart into what the rest of the songs are going to sound like, whilst 'Ignorance' shows a bit more of a dark side of Williams. 'The Only Exception' is a cheesy, but enlightened power ballad that will certainly pleases fans of Avril Lavigne, while 'All I Wanted' is a darker, more Kelly Clarkson-influenced ballad that perfectly defines 'an emo day'.Brand New Eyes may not be the greatest pop punk album, but it is certainly the band's greatest.

She has such a lovely voice that is so much more emotional in some of these songs than most of her YYYs songs. The showstopping numbers are the least children album-y, 'Worried Shoes' and 'Hideaway.' The former is a cover of a Daniel Johnston song, but Karen does such a tender, beautiful rendition of it that it definitely becomes the best song here. Runner up is the other ballad, 'Hideaway,' which is actually quite sad lyrically ('My baby is gone...'), but is incredibly beautiful. She has done these crazy antics her whole career, calming down every now and then ('Maps,' 'Dudley,' and 'Little Shadow', so about once each record). But this is unprecedented beauty from Karen. The more upbeat less personal songs work great too ('Capsize,' 'Rumpus,' 'Animal,' and the keening amazing single 'All is Love.')

I certainly can see both points of view with this band: those who are charmed by their ragged garage band tunes and sunny girl-group harmonies and those who find VG to be below par due to their seeming lack of musical chops. The truth probably lies somewhere between these two camps, but for those who enjoyed the debut this album has plenty going for it. The material does seem to tilt to the darker side, but much of the music is bright and peppy. It is ragged (in a good way) and I think any comments suggesting VG are amateur are patently unfair. I know plenty of amateur musicians who couldn't pull off what VG do. These girls know what they are doing and I for one look forward to following their career arc because I think the best is yet to come for VG.

That however doesnt make the song suddenly mindblowing either, and that's exactly my problem with the Arctics. The level of mediocricity they keep reaching since their great debut. Dance Little Liar, My Propeller and Secret Door are good though. Overall, not as good as their debut but better again after the dreadful Favourite worst nightmare, just a good album nothing more nothing less. Though they should change their sound more drastically by making it more melodically, a few effects ebows etc to keep the interest in their band alive otherwise this once hyped band will quickly fade away i'm afraid...

Both of the albums followed the same sort of formula, a fast and loud opening to the album where Matt Helders skillfull drumming pulls you in, followed by a few of the and just as enjoyable tune, usually including one of the hits, then slowing it down a bit in the middle of the album (WPSIATIWIAN - Riot Van), (Favourite Worst Nightmare - Only Ones Who Know) and then living the mood up again with more energetic teen pleasers then bunging another hit towards the end and then finishing with a long melodic ups and downs sort of song that leaves you humming the jangly guitar outa buzzing in your head... Humbug totally goes against their usually formula, the album starting with both catchy and calm yet aggressive songs and then just having the mood of the album change every song then ending with still a very long song but a very minor tone to the song and yes it does have a jangly guitar sound to finish but its not one that is supposed to keep you humming, one to let you know that they will be back, like a tune played into at the end of a hollywood film that expects to have a sequal when the main charachter vanishes into the horizon and your left wondering... whats going to happen? It cant end so sad!

My Propeller, Crying Lightning, Cornerstone, Dangerous Animals, and Pretty Visitors are standout tracks. This one's definitely a grower.

I like every song on this this one, as with the previous ones, but obviously they've gone in a different direction. With the exception of 'Potion Approaching' & 'Pretty Visitors' there are no real upbeat, fast songs. I find it difficult to listen to the album as a whole- meaning all the way thru from track 1 thru track 10. But listening to them individually, two or three tracks at a time, I like every song. Maybe that's odd, but who cares. Turner's vocals remind me alot like Morrissey's and the lyrics are more cryptic.

Cornerstone is genius, and his songwriting ability is fulfilled to the maximum in particular on this and Dangerous Animals and Pretty Visitors. Don't expect any anthems aboard here just pure innovative sound of the Monkeys exploring different sounds. My Propeller is probably as close to the previous outings as you will get.

This is the essence of danish music, as well as being the album that must reach out for the masses, not just in Europe, but in the world. Mew have found the balance between the introvert and personal and the bombastic and outgoing. It will appeal to anyone who appreciates music (sofisticated and innovative music that is). There are songs that will grab on to everyone with a preference for hook-based pop melodies (beach, vaccine), but also the ones who'd rather listen to something complex and grandiose (Hawaii, Cartoons and macram wounds). At the same time the grandiose doesn't precent the hooks, so if you appreciate Hawaii, you're just as likely to love Beach. With No More Stories... we can only hope that Mew will have the international breakthrough they clearly deserve. Let yourself into the heart's delight of this '09 masterpiece.",0,0,"Aug 29, 2009"

Song 1... Prologue... is the prologue
Song 2... Kettering... girl is in hospital because a guy beat her up with a bone... she's really sad and quiet but her nurse decides to take care of her because its his job
Song 3... Atrophy... he does surgery to take the bullets out of her body and puts them inside of himself... it makes him so sad that he gives her 'a trophy' for making him so sad...
Song 4... Bear... while he is performing surgery he finds out that there is actually a live bear inside her stomach as well, he gets into an argument with the bear about whether they're too old or not old at all
Thirteen... while he is doing surgery there is a little woman inside where the bear was and it sings a song to him asking to pull her out also
Two... I dunno what this song is about really but i think he's talking about her past and then the doctor tells him he has to stop trying to help her because there is way too much **** inside her... the bear has grown angry and it breaks all the light bulbs and glass rains down from the ceiling...
Shiva... she takes off a ring and puts it on his finger and it turns him into Shiva, from the Final Fantasy series, but as he's transforming the 'sensation is shivers' because he's ice elemental and it's real cold
Wake... spoiler alert... he wakes up and it was all a dream... but then a helicopter comes outside his window and she's inside of it but he ties the rope around his neck... and dies
Epilogue... they both die and they are buried together but they are still alive and she is screaming so much that he can't sleep",1,3,"May 22, 2011"

10,"Haunting, harrowing, and beautiful. It's a stunning concept album that you need to listen to straight through to really appreciate. I've heard varying perspectives on the story it tells, but to me it's about an emotionally abusive relationship in which the narrator tries to hold on to his relationship with a girl struggling to deal with her own possibly trauma-induced emotions. This is told through an allegory of a hospital worker in a cancer ward who falls in love with a patient whose imminent death is the catalyst for their tumultuous relationship. The two stories blend ethereally together, almost as if drifting in and out of consciously, while other heart-breaking metaphors bleed into the story. The content of the lyrics is intense and the gorgeous, electronic and folk-influenced music creates a dangerous atmosphere that will draw you fully into the words. The album has no 'happy' or 'light' songs. The first lyrics of the album (in the song 'Kettering') are 'I wish that I had known in that first minute we met, the unpayable debt that I'd owe you'. If you've ever felt pain from a relationship in your life (whether romantic or not) you'll be able to relate to the feelings the narrator displays for us  the panic and horror of trying to hold on to something you know won't last, the feeling that your entire being is tearing apart when it ends, and the fear that you may never be the same person again.
As a side note, it would definitely be helpful to follow along with the lyrics, because often, the narrator sometimes sings in undertones and the words often blend into the music to create that dream-like atmosphere. The downside is that you may miss a lot of the brilliantly poetic lyrics if you don't follow along.",0,0,"Oct 16, 2013"
10,"It's more than a bunch of songs; it's a complete work of art, a story, a life, a new and aural experience. Few albums had such impact in my life so as to change it significantly: Hospice is one of them. It's simply magic.",0,0,"Dec 31, 2014"
0,"Honestly... It's like sonic valium. I commend them for making a concept album in this day and age, and Peter Silberman can certainly write poetic lyrics, but the musical content is garbage. What disappoints me so much is that they've demonstrated that they're fairly capable musicians, yet somehow this happened. There are definitely moments of ingenuity, but otherwise there's a lot of pointless noise. Their instrumental sections are in the same vein as Death Cab For Cutie, except not done even half as well and certainly not very cleverly.
Some of the songs are pretty nice, such as Bear, but overall they're far too droning and don't carry enough weight to make the ambiance worth it. Plus the production is TERRIBLE. Holy **** I CANNOT stress that enough. Whoever mixed/mastered it either had no idea what the **** they were doing, or let someone with really bad ideas dictate what they did. I understand that everyone has different ideas on what constitutes 'good' especially when it comes to artistic merit (irrespective of commercial viability). But it's important to note that there's a fine line between being an artist of high-caliber and making garbage. The Antlers have yet to find that line.",0,0,"Mar 21, 2014"

9,"Allmusic dot com's Heather Phares describes the FF as 'restless sonic chameleons' and no truer sentiment has ever been written about these sibs. Another winning release from these Brooklynites definitely benefits from a sharper focus and a reigning in of arrangements. Lovely piano, shredding guitars and Eleanor's lovely voice highlight these strong compositions. The second side of the record is especially strong; 'Evergreen' has always been my fave FF tune, but 'Lost at Sea' is challenging for the mantle. The awesome rhythm section of Jason Loewenstein and Bob D'Amico bring it throughout. As far as the reviews are concerned, allmusic and popmatters reviews are both worth a read.

10,"'People Say' is a great song to start the album on. From there the transitions from song to song flow immaculately. makes it really easy to hit hit play and listen to the whole album in one shot. can't say much for 'Work All Day'. the message is pretty simple; don't get stuck in a rut where you work all day and all night and have no time for a life, and eventually you die sad and lonely. 'Lovers in Love' is, in my opinion, the best song on the album by far. Percussions and violin add to the fast paced nature of the song. has a great story, I feel like I could break the law to this song and get away with it (but I won't). After that, is popular Portugal. the man song, 'The Sun'. I was impressed with this song for a few reasons, the harmonious singing was very well done, especially at 1:45 into the song where the guitar adds a generous boost of good feelings for the song and the singers.The Synth adds nicely to the structured chaos towards the end of the song. I recommend this song as a first listen for Portugal. The Man. It makes you feel great. 'The Home' is my least favorite song on the album. It's relatively slow, unlike the rest of the album and the guitar solo kills it for me, it sounds flat and uninteresting (no offence to anyone who likes happens to like the song). 'The Woods' is a bad-ass song to make love to. the triangle stroke at the end of the drum line always caught my attention and I begun to enjoy it. Vocals and bass work very nicely together, vocals are the best in this song on the album. I wish 'Guns & Dogs' was longer cause its a great example of the style of the album. It's mellow and retro and holds an 'in your face' attitude. 'Do You' has a great story to it, I find it to be a little religious but I don't think the intention is to promote Christianity, rather the nature of the song. The third verse in the song provides a key-changing resolution for the rest of the song. Great part. 'Everyone is Golden' starts nicely, but then by the chorus it gets a little dry for me with its stop and go melody which follows to the end. Not one of the better songs on the album. The next song, 'Let You Down', was a nice piece, it doesn't follow the rest of the album however. I feel like it should have been better truly acoustic rather than using small time, cheap effects. That's just me though. 'Mornings' is a very subtle song. Again, the use of small time add in and cheap effects in some parts. However, a very interesting guitar part presents itself around 1:30 and then another solo at 2:50 comes graciously in sweeps you away. This album never got the recognition it deserves and neither does Portugal. The Man. One of my favorite albums of all time! worth the time to listen to it like I have done countless times.",0,0,"Jan  6, 2011"

10,"Probably one of the best dance albums of all time, the album starts and ends with the same vocalists and really shows his vocal ability (the first song features an extensive use of autotune whilst the final track has a beautiful acoustic voice with backing vocals by the two band members). Every song is beautifully crafted and produced which shows how much emotion was put into the album. Daft Punk's first album Homework was meant to be one of the most influential dance albums ever, but I think Discovery tops that.",1,1,"Jun 29, 2012"
10,"Though many could consider Homework or Random Access Memories their milestonesHomework for contributing to modern electronic music (and simply because it's their debut album) and RAM for its commercial breakthrough and refinement to an era of EDM where everyone wants to be David GuettaDiscovery is truly where it all began, in my opinion. Not just the beginning of Thomas Bangalter and Guy-Manuel de Homem Christo's robotic alter egoscaused by a September 9th, 1999 accident in their studio, ahem. But the beginning of an era where electronic music began again. Discovery could be considered a main highlight in the early noughties, with 'One More Time' being noteworthy as one of the greatest singles of the decade and 'Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger' being sampled by Kanye West then remixed into their Alive tour, however, it's just a work of art in its own right, disregarding Pitchfork and all that praised it in their year-end lists.
Technically speakingif I spoke from my own fangirl alter ego, I'd simply say 'This album is **** amazing' and nothing elseDiscovery has a polished production that's almost insulting for the simple fact that it's samples layered upon samples, which would later end up being sampled by other artists. And yet it's all original in its own right, especially considering the obscurity of the samples chosen. It's obviously not a concept album, but to recommend single songs off of the album seems impossible, considering it'd strip the mood from when you listen to it on continuous play. From the sappy, feel-good vibes in its lead single and 'Digital Love' to the funky, chill vibes in 'Something About Us', it's astonishing how cohesive a dance album can actually be. To sum it all up, it's amazing, there.",1,1,"Sep 19, 2014"

'Aerodynamic' has one of the greatest guitar solos I've ever heard, 'One More Time' makes you wanna get up and just dance, and 'Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger' is just a magnificent song. But then other songs such as 'Nightvisions' is basically looking at Daft Punk at another angle, so to speak. It shows another side of them that were not used to from their first album. And that's definitely a good thing. All In All, 'Discovery' by Daft Punk is an innovative and original album that I can proudly say is one of my favorites. A-",0,0,"Dec 12, 2010"

9,"I think this is an excellent album.  In fact, it's so good, I'm confused about the Pitchfork review that gave it 4.1 stars.  Yes, I agree, Ebert has reemerged with a different style lead singer than he was with Ima Robot, but so what?  How is this any different than the Beatles starting the 60's with a rather clean cut (if somewhat moppy-headed) aura and ending in the late 60's with long hair and beards, ushering in Eastern religion into the cultural milieu of the day?  Big deal.  People change.  Artists change.  Most lasting musicians reinvent themselves several times throughout their career.  In fact, the mark of a musician that does typically last is his/her inability or unwillingness to reinvent his/her personal presentation.  So now that we've gotten that out of the way, and we're facing the truth that musicians do actually make music to succeed, and in order to succeed, they have to sell albums, let's turn to the music.  I'll get the hard part out of the way.  This band is clearly not trying to fit in with the modern 'acceptable range' of music (Arcade Fire, Florence + the Machine, etc) today, which mostly deals in cutting looks at the negatives we see in the world today.  Their '1960's hippie' feel in 2010 simply shows their courage to display something different.  I'm not too happy with the 'messianic' presentation of 'Edward Sharpe' he's painted, but leaving that behind, the music is simply stellar.  This is a well-studied reinterpretation of 1960's psychedelic folk rock.  It's one of the most laid back albums in that genre that you're going to find, that doesn't go overboard with an unusual obsession for Bob Marley, the Beatles, or any other major root.  They show an honest respect for their predecessors without sounding repetitive or too focused on one influence or another.  In other words, they're original, without being too original, and they've aimed for, and successfully recreated the sound of an era, presenting it in a way that is palatable to the modern ear.  There's not a single song on this album that is going to grate on your nerves.  To be honest, the album leaves you feeling happy and relaxed.  If you're looking for a sharp dystopian outlook on suburban life, or a depressing analysis of modern information overload, look elsewhere, there's none of that here.  There's a playful innocence to this album that is as happy as the Weepies, without sounding too saccharin at the same time.  My guess is that many who reviewed this album were simply not approaching it with an open mind.  So many recent albums that have come out recently are based around a sharp, sometimes biting analysis of the woes of the current economic crisis or the seeming lack of authenticity in the world today, that we've adjusted our palettes to hear this kind of music.  Expect good music from this album, and listen to it on a day when you're not trying to find misery as your best company, and you'll find yourself pleasantly surprised.",0,1,"Dec  4, 2010"

There is not one weak track on an album filled with passionate, driving tunes about nostalgia, youth, lost relationships and lost homes. The drumwork on display is among the finest I've heard in a long time, and the Nils Edenloff's Mangum-esque vocals only serve to hammer home the pain, joy, heartbreak, and memory that is so pervasive throughout this album. In short, this is THE definitive summer album of the past few years, possibly the best summer album since Wilco's Summerteeth.

8,"A great debut from a very promising band. 'Don't Haunt this Place' and 'In the Summertime' in particular are two of my favorite tracks from 2008. The album's only significant flaw is that the two weakest tracks, 'The Air' and 'Sleep All Day' (both of which, in my opinion, probably could have just been cut) are slotted one after another, smack in the middle of the album; needless to say, this sequencing really disrupts the record's flow.

Opener 'Emergency Contraception Blues' is the albums most interesting track and also the highlight of the record. 'Evening/Morning' is another nice track.

10,"This album kicks so much ass it's hard to describe. I had to sit on a block of ice after listening to it. Silver Moons is a wonderful opener, and the piano-and-voice bridge is nothing short of sublime. Apollo and the Buffalo is essentially a pop song with some obscure lyrics about Greek God's and some girl named Anna playing the guitar, and it's one of the catchiest song's Sunset's ever done. You Go On Ahead is awesome. That's about it. Nightingale features some of the best (and most understandable) lyrics Spencer's ever written and it's a big departure from the rest of the album. Dragon's Lair is, without a doubt, the greatest song Spencer's ever written. This thing is huge. It's fucking epic. And even though it's 10 and a half minutes, it flies by and I wouldn't mind it being longer. The only weak song is Paper Lace (and that's weak by Spencer Krug standards, which is still better than most things out there today) - I preferred the Enemy Mine version. But this one's still good.... The only thing I wish they would have done with this album is make it longer. Maybe add that guitar version of Coming to at Dawn they've been playing on tour. That would have been great. But alas, I guess I'll just have to wait for the next Spencer Krug album - it shouldn't be more than a few months. Get it.",0,0,"Jul  3, 2009"

'Silver Moons' is amazing, forget how it ties into the last song. 'Idiot Heart' was my fave song at first easy. And that 'hope you die line' was on par with previous amazing SR lines.

This frustrates me as a lot of people obviously like this music but as with the Animal Collective this doesn't move me. They have been compared to Radiohead and I love In Rainbows (in my opinion the best album in years) but i think this album lacks heart/soul/connect with the listener (or at least me) and so it is easier to admire than love.

I pity those who listen to it once and dismiss it as they are missing out on something special. From the grandiose opener Southern Point to the gorgeous closer Foreground it is an intricate and delicate musical experience.

8,"Don't get me wrong - this is a fantastic album. My problem with it is that there are a few songs here that are actually perfect and show what Grizzly Bear is capable of. Both Horn of Plenty and Yellow House interspersed their 'wow' moments evenly throughout the album, often putting them in the middle of songs that meandered and explored musical space for a few minutes before really opening up. The result was fascinating and consistent. On Veckatimest, they have split their explorations and their explosions into different songs entirely, and it's incredibly frustrating to me. After hearing a Two Weeks or While You Wait for the Others, both of which are pop perfection all the way through, it becomes harder to want Grizzly Bear to meander on a song like Dory (easily the weakest track on here). So ultimately, the opening and closing of the album are some of the best I will hear all year, but the middle drags in a way that other Grizzly Bear albums haven't.",0,0,"May 26, 2009"

6,"If this band comes through my hometown, or even a neighboring city, I'll go the distance to see them, because I bet it will be a killer show and a few dollars well spent for a good night of uptempo rockin' out. But this record is an extremely well-executed re-tread of old indie pop rock territory at best, combining Strokes-inspired American Rock vocals with the uptempo 4/4 lifeless sheen of British indie rock. The British influence is quite clear, and in fact you'll note that reviewers from across the pond are the ones giving this record the chilliest reception, because they've learned the hard way to distrust indie-pop polish as a sign of greatness (or one hopes they have). A few good singles for the dance floor do not earn a 10 (or even an 8). The most redeeming quality of this record is the lyrics, which carry much more pleasing (actually, wonderfully intelligent) nuance than this music usually attempts, good enough, in fact, to push it into the 8s if it weren't for the fact that they're all delivered over basically the same musical vehicle, which incapacitates great lines like 'Do you remember when 21 was young' by drawing attention to the fact that this band is aging and still hasn't figured out a way to put their greatest strength at the forefront. Just a little quietness or a little more swagger, a shift or disruption of the pounding 4 on the floor, a little break from the Strokes-esque removal with which all the lyrics are delivered would push this to greatness. This fairly serious misstep earns Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart a 6 in my book instead of the 7 I want to give out for those lyrics. This record will be fun for a good long while (read: 3-4 months), and then the next thing will come along. However, until that happens, I intend to happily soak this record up in all its arpeggio'd glory and get my dance on.",0,0,"Jun  4, 2009"

10,"Perfect records do not come around often. Especially in this day in age. But when one does, I think we need to go out of our way to note that. This album is the best album of its genre in years. The production is perfect, not overdone. The songs are catchy, but not over-play catchy. Can't get sick of them-catchy is more like it. Will be listening to this one for years to go. The instrumental 'Love Like A Sunset' (Pt 1 & 2) Breaks the album up perfectly to two parts with two climaxes.",0,0,"May 27, 2009"

8,"To be honest I had never heard of Phoenix before my friend told me to check this album out. I put it on not knowing what to expect. At first I didn't want to like it after a little while (and a couple listens) I couldn't stop humming the songs and dancing. With this album Phoenix takes jangley pop, dance beats and sonic tones and combines them in such a way that it is almost insulting to mention them in the same sentence as The Strokes, who I think are very one demensional. As I said, I haven't listened to any other albums of theres so I don't know much about where they're coming from, but I do know I like where they are now and I'm interested in where they're going. This is a fun album that I really enjoy!",0,0,"Jun 23, 2009"

8,"Brilliant first half! Listzomania and Love Like A Sunset (pts. I and II) are definite highlights, the latter surely the best track of the year (after AC's' My Girls'). The first five tracks' sheer exuberance and quality are enough to make this a good album, and whilst tracks like 'Countdown' and 'Armistace' do feel a little anonymous, the beautiful 'Girlfriend' and Strokes-ish 'Rome' make up for them. Wow!",0,0,"Jul 15, 2009"

8,"This will dig its way into your brain, featuring some of the hookiest synth-rock I've ever heard. Passion Pit's use of a real, live drummer instead of programmed beats adds a great layer to the sound and makes it more human and listenable. The layered synths perfectly complement the sky-high falsetto vocals to give the listener a feeling that everything, at least for the moment, is going to be OK. If it wasn't for the over-use of  children's choir backing vocals, I'd rate this even higher.",0,0,"Jul 14, 2011"

10,"Manners is much more than a bland electro-pop indie scene hype-fest, it is an extremely well-done and addicting album which delivers on all levels. Tasteful and fun electronica, interwoven instrumental recordings, and highly entrancing falsetto vocals all go into making this a highly thematic and enjoyable album. It rarely offers a dull moment, keeping emotions and energy high, while still ignoring empty over-popped indie hits with interesting song structure and true substance that goes past normal expectations. I've listened to this album for a long time, and it constantly maintains its position as my favorite album, a true work of art which is filled with musical expertise that you can hardly find anywhere else. I highly recommend this album.",0,0,"Nov 17, 2013"
