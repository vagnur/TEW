AllMusic,80,"If Dark Dark Dark are one of many acts who seem to define the realm of vaguely quirky and slightly winsome indie rock of the 21st century, the lean of the performances tends toward the quietly contemplative above all else, however much in a band context.","Oct  2, 2012"

Delusions of Adequacy,80,"Pop sensibilities are allowed to swell over, into and around each other; each song blends the seams of the core into a fragmented, disjointed, appropriately-meshing of sounds and in the end, Love this Giant is a magnificent triumph because of it all.","Sep 11, 2012"

Paste Magazine,90,"The controversy nearly obscured the resounding triumph of the album itself; written and produced by Burton and Linkous, it's a breathtaking set of atmospheric ballads (plus a few rockers) that explore cosmic concerns, from the self-destructive trap of revenge to the possibility of spiritual renewal.","Jun  1, 2010"
Lost At Sea,89,"It's a shame if Dark Night of the Soul ends up relegated to a cult souvenir; it's truly exceptional as music.","Jun  1, 2010"

NOW Magazine,80,"Linkous's vocals make only a few brief appearances, but so much of his personality is in the songs that it feels almost like a tribute album he had a hand in recording. A proper coda to a storied, tragic career.","Jun  1, 2010"
Sputnikmusic,80,"And through the tragedy, what remains, this testament, is a spiraling exercise in gorgeous music, a record knee deep in that subtle legend, but ankle up a collection of tunes as haunting and surreal as the personas and events that surrounded it.","Jun  1, 2010"
Drowned In Sound,80,"Often collaborative projects end up being an average of its participants, merging in the middle in a grey mulch. Dark Night of the Soul escapes all of that, Sparklehorse bringing the songwriting genius, and Danger Mouse the production, and the details - the watery sounds, the effects, the atmosphere.","Jun  1, 2010"
Los Angeles Times,75,"There's a hesitating beauty to the nightmares explored on 'Dark Night,' from the keyboard symphonies of 'Revenge,' featuring a calmly paranoid vocal take from the Flaming Lips' Wayne Coyne, to the carnival-like haunt of 'Everytime I'm with You,' led by a leery Jason Lytle (Grandaddy).","Jun  1, 2010"
The Boston Phoenix,75,"Every song here showcases Linkus's gift for pinpointing little benchmarks in hopelessness with brittle gestures of melody and ambiance. It's also another reminder of Danger Mouse's ability to whittle lean pop shivs from gnarly splinters.","Jun  1, 2010"
Pitchfork,74,"Dark Night is a well-sequenced and unique album that ingeniously balances its contributors' strengths with the overall theme of the work--self-examination, often under stark circumstances, in the interest of understanding one's own existence.","Jun  1, 2010"
Billboard.com,72,"It's the airtight beats of Danger Mouse and the surreal songwriting of Linkous that make this a fascinating set.","Jun  1, 2010"

No Ripcord,70,"As it stands, there is a lot to like here and a lot to digest. One advantage to having so many vocalists is that each song can be separated and dealt with accordingly, giving the record the sort of film soundtrack feel I think the principle authors were aiming for. Other than that, this unburdens Sparklehorse fans slightly of the wait between albums by providing a mainly interesting and, at times, genuinely moving distraction.","Jun  1, 2010"
AllMusic,70,"Despite the delay, Dark Night of the Soul shows what a talent and what a generous collaborator we lost in Mark Linkous.","Jun  1, 2010"

The A.V. Club,67,"Dark Night is a vocal showcase: Lynch, James Mercer of The Shins and Broken Bells, The Flaming Lips' Wayne Coyne, Iggy Pop, and several more stamp the tracks with appropriately brooding vocals. Only a few really stick, and not always in a good way.","Jun  1, 2010"
The New York Times,60,"Here were two artists, anxious and passionate, who knew how to talk to each other. That connection is missing from much of the rest of this collection, an exercise in Rolodex-flexing and loose oversight.","Jun  1, 2010"

Uncut,60,"Dark Night Of The Soul will probably be remembered more for the stunt with the blank CD-Rs than for the music intended to be burnt onto them.","Jun  1, 2010"
The Wire,60,"The feeling of opiated depressive inertia that weighs it down is compounded by the sugary viscosity of Danger Mouse;s production. Yet it's these slower songs, shaped by Linkous's Country-inflected enervation and Danger Mouse's attention to sonic detail, that work best, while the more up tempo, rockier tracks come off as perfunctory. [Jul 2010, p.53]","Jun  1, 2010"

PopMatters,70,"The weaknesses of The Five Ghosts are few and far between and, overall, it's an enjoyable and satisfying record for one of indie pop's most consistent bands.","May 25, 2010"
Urb,70,"At its best moments, the latest effort from Stars yearns for the flicker flame of 'Set Yourself on Fire,' but it is neither as gorgeous as nor is it as jarring a mixed bag as 'In Our Bedroom.'","May 25, 2010"
The A.V. Club,67,"While it's all tricky, well-crafted music about heartbreak, nothing here breaks hearts the way the best Stars tracks over the years have done. Instead, Stars settle for big hooks and big emotions that inspire more admiration than empathy.","May 25, 2010"
Boston Globe,60,"Stars may be moving beyond songs like the soothing and dramatic opener 'Dead Hearts,' but it's not quite clear where they're going.","May 25, 2010"
Spin,60,"Ghosts' flowing, synth-backed melodies are a vast improvement on 2006's hammy In Our Bedroom After the War, if not 2004's near-perfect Set Yourself on Fire. Cute isn't what Stars aim for, but it's often what they achieve.","May 25, 2010"
AllMusic,60,"While a few hooks stand out--particularly the 'fisticuffs' chorus of 'Fixed'--most of the songs are too watered down, lyrically and musically, to be truly enticing.","May 25, 2010"
NOW Magazine,60,"The elegant album is wisely paced, cinematic with strings and keyboards, and Campbell and Millan sound great together. But despite the emotional drama on offer, it fails to be moving.","May 25, 2010"
No Ripcord,60,"The Five Ghosts chooses to communicate in a simpler, terser manner, which counteracts their evident vigor to test out miscellaneous musical approaches. By switching their objective, Stars' fifth effort has become their true reversal of fortune.","May 25, 2010"
Clash Music,60,"Wasted Daylight, a sugary, ambient number, offers a particularly sublime performance from Millan, as does He Dreams He's Awake, of Campbell. However, these two are the fairly obvious highlights in an otherwise misfired effort.","May 25, 2010"
The Guardian,60,"Their fifth album typifies Stars' more epic melodrama--in awe of Prefab Sprout, New Order and the 1980s to the point where you can imagine videos featuring moody-looking types staring over windswept beaches, pondering Russian novels and their spots. It's all absurdly pretty.","May 25, 2010"
Uncut,60,"The overall effect is all a bit 'earnest teen drama'--'Dead Hearts' is a surely shoo-in for the soundtrack of the next Twilight movie--but the hit-rate is impressively high. [Sep 2010, p.104]","May 25, 2010"
Pitchfork,57,"They know bombast and melodrama, which makes a decent amount of their latest effort, The Five Ghosts, all the more off-putting.","May 25, 2010"
Slant Magazine,50,"The formula works better elsewhere (see the perky, airy single 'Fixed'), but like the adolescent musings that serve as its inspiration, The Five Ghosts is, at best, awkwardly sweet and, at worst, fumbling and tone-deaf.","May 25, 2010"

Dusted Magazine,80,"He's turned a hard patch into something transcendental. However brief, however ephemeral, there's a sense of spiritual overcoming that encompasses not just his own history, but the experiences that listeners bring to these sad songs, as well.","May 25, 2010"
musicOMH.com,80,"Boys Inside is Mason's best work since his Beta Band days - a rich, dark slice of mournful, glacial electronica with a heart. Richard X has smoothed away the edges, yet lets Mason stamp his personality on proceedings.","May 25, 2010"
New Musical Express (NME),80,"This album offers an elegant blend of trilling piano, strummed guitar and crisp digital beats, but it's dominated by Mason's voice, and his monastic chants prove as soothing and stirring as when they wafted across The Beta Band's deathless debut 'Dry The Rain'.","May 25, 2010"
PopMatters,80,"Like his psychedelic forebear, Mason's music is evocative enough of his former glories to draw those fans in, but compelling enough on its own to keep them there.","May 25, 2010"

AllMusic,80,"Mason's career has been one of constant starts and stops and side-project misdirections (for his fans, at least), so the straightforwardly eccentric Boys Outside is clearly a record to treasure.","May 25, 2010"
Tiny Mix Tapes,80,"It's fitting that Mason reserved his first official solo album for his best work since The Beta Band. The results prove well worth the wait.","May 25, 2010"

cokemachineglow,73,"Typically heavy subject matter aside, Mason actually seems more content in his skin than he has in some time, and anyone who has previously garnered enjoyment from the Beta Band or King Biscuit Time will unquestionably find something to dig within Boys Outside.","May 25, 2010"
BBC Music,70,"This is the most balanced album of Mason's career, or certainly the least precipitous. There is still a yawning void beneath him, but for once it doesn't sound as if he's about to fall into it, and you can't help but share his relief.","May 25, 2010"
Drowned In Sound,70,"It defies the listener not to nod their head and tap a foot, layering foreboding piano, languid acoustic guitar and a swampy riff under semi-rapped verses and a chorus about being found at the bottom of a river, and demonstrates Mason embracing his albatross with the ease of a man only too pleased to have one.","May 25, 2010"
Pitchfork,70,"In both its lyrical candour and soft-rock accessibility, Boys Outside sees Mason ready to meet the public again, and in some cases, actually cater to it.","May 25, 2010"

BBC Music,80,"Total Life Forever's break with the past is astutely judged, the execution is even better.","May 25, 2010"
Clash Music,80,"Total Life Forever is a massive leap forward for the band. The music writhes with a renewed ambition, capable of moving from near ambient strains of electronica to propulsive African funk in a drum break.","May 25, 2010"
New Musical Express (NME),80,"It takes half a dozen listens before the quality of it really sinks in, and is so all over the place that only the most devoted won't find it initially maddening. But throughout is a braveness and naive sense of wonder.","May 25, 2010"

PopMatters,80,"If this is their The Bends, it remains to be seen whether they can eventually produce another evolutionary leap on the orders of OK Computer and Kid A, but for the first time that kind of greatness doesn't seem out of the question for Foals.","May 25, 2010"
Delusions of Adequacy,80,"Total Life Forever is still thoroughly identifiable as a Foals album, their personality and songwriting quirks shine through even the thickest of creative haze--they're making pop out of art, which is a pretty good recipe for a young band.","May 25, 2010"

Drowned In Sound,70,"It's not got the immediate clout of Antidotes; and it's not one to spin when prepping for a party (it's actually kind of a downer, apart from 'Miami', which kills). But if you work with it, something really ghostly happens.","May 25, 2010"

AllMusic,70,"Where some see restraint, others may very well see refinement, and those who appreciated Antidotes' more spacy passages will find that Foals' reinvention of their sound is a calculated risk that definitely pays off.","May 25, 2010"

Tiny Mix Tapes,60,"At its core, Total Life Forever is a good dance record: something you could leave on at a party and not stop moving to until its full 50 minutes have finished. But as much as it tries to run away from that, it isn't a whole lot else.","May 25, 2010"
Austin Chronicle,50,"Foals' major label debut, Total Life Forever, keeps those elements intact, most notably on the title track and in the calculated urgency and cold sweat of 'After Glow,' but the band has redesigned the template to include a more expansive pop approach evinced by sprawling centerpiece 'Spanish Sahara.'","May 25, 2010"

BBC Music,80,"Whether or not the addition of Burrows is solely responsible for the improvement in consistency on this fourth album isn't clear, but Barbara is their best work by far. Current fans will be glad and new ones may be easier to come by.","May 18, 2010"

Billboard.com,74,"Rock act We Are Scientists typically has a good sense of what hits, but on its latest album, Barbara, the band begins to figure out what misses.","May 18, 2010"
Dot Music,70,"True, there isn't necessarily the one big hitter that will guarantee the Scientists' vault back into the big time limelight. But Barbara is packed full of enough immediate favourites to claw back their fan base from the off.","May 18, 2010"
Alternative Press,70,"On 2008's Brain Thrust Mastery, the trio attempted to inject a bit more seriousness and Brit-pop influence into their best-when-kept-simple sound, to varying results, but Barbara finds them back in their comfort zone--fun, danceable pop-rock.","May 18, 2010"
PopMatters,70,"Barbara accomplishes something pretty rare. It successfully combines the best elements of two very different predecessors into one complete sound. Every track on this album isn't a total winner, but enough of them are to leave a strong overall impression.","May 18, 2010"

Sputnikmusic,60,"Barbara is pure We Are Scientists, and in the context of the band's discography, it's hopelessly unoriginal but undoubtedly strong, the kind of record that will either have you tearing out your hair in frustration at a band that showed so much promise or singing along in your car to a CD chock-full of superb sing-a-longs.","May 18, 2010"

Drowned In Sound,50,"Listening to Barbara is like watching the England football team; expectations are high at the outset and true to form, things get off to a rousing start. However, after the halfway mark normality sets in, there's an alarming sense of underachievement and long before its conclusion, you're dismissing them as hapless failures.","May 18, 2010"
The Guardian,40,"We Are Scientists know how to create instantly catchy tunes, unfortunately they've yet to master making them stick in the memory bank.","May 18, 2010"

Pitchfork,90,"For those who've been following along for a few years, this is a groundbreaking record that condenses and amplifies Ariel Pink's most accessible tendencies. But the brilliant thing about Before Today is that no prior knowledge of his catalog is required.","May 18, 2010"
Tiny Mix Tapes,90,"Before Today is the best collection of pure pop songs released this year, and the experimental odds and bits only add to its considerable charm.","May 18, 2010"
PopMatters,90,"Pink has an amazing ability to surprise and does so again and again on Before Today.","May 18, 2010"
Lost At Sea,90,"It's strange second-hand pop, deconstructed and represented as something entirely new, augmented by a range of melodies and affectations.

Delusions of Adequacy,80,"Even with some of the smoke and mirrors removed, Ariel Pink is still a singular talent.","May 18, 2010"
The New York Times,80,"Before Today is another fun Ariel Pink pop/rock record, more solidly constructed than any of his past efforts. Even more importantly, its also more joyously musical than most full-lengths that have been coming out in recent years, aware not of self and scene but only of the fact that music is fun and feels good.","May 18, 2010"

The A.V. Club,80,"Even better is Round and Round, with its jagged interludes and echoes of Arthur Russell. A metaphor for life as a merry-go-round, the song eventually comes into focus and ramps up into a wild roller-coaster ride. The same could be said of this exhilarating album.","May 18, 2010"
cokemachineglow,75,"Rosenberg has spent time in a real studio with a real band, and while the resulting album, Before Today, is still lo-fi and crackpot, its remarkable how good Ariel Pinks Haunted Graffiti can sound with just a little cleanup.","May 18, 2010"
Dusted Magazine,74,"While he may be fundamentally un-reconstructed, Pinks clearly a more polished revisionist, more polished than hes ever been, and while it may not be conventionally recorded, Before Today still feels punchily archetypal.","May 18, 2010"
Slant Magazine,70,"Before Today accomplishes exactly the same thing all his other good records do, so Im not sure it does much for me that, say, House Arrest didnt. Nonetheless, its still one of his better records--there are some excellent pop songs here, and its a good place to start for listeners who are unfamiliar with Pinks bizarre schtick.","May 18, 2010"
Spin,70,"There are times when the garish rehash feels a tad too on the nose.","May 18, 2010"
musicOMH.com,70,"Before Today still sounds like it was dubbed to cassette and left on the dash of a 1983 Datsun for an entire summer. Every aspect seems faded and warped, but that doesn't obscure Pink's savvy maneuvering.","May 18, 2010"

Paste Magazine,83,"Most of the music on Deer Tick's third album, The Black Dirt Sessions, was recorded back in 2008, during the sessions for the rollicking Born On Flag Day, but it'd be a mistake to think of these songs as leftovers.","May 18, 2010"
Absolute Punk (Staff reviews),82,"The Black Dirt Sessions is this band's 'After the Goldrush,' stuffed with devastating songs laid bare by weathered, redemption-seeking renegades.","May 18, 2010"

Spin,75,"While not punch-for-punch or track-for-track the heavy-hitter 'War Elephant' was, or even offering the tonal variety of 'Born on Flag Day,' the consistency has come into its own doleful focus, the lyrics have reached a blisteringly high point and for any/all flaws, and, in the end, it just leaves me holding the broken pieces of my face in my fucking hands.","May 18, 2010"

Pitchfork,80,"The songs are absolutely confident that every repetition is worthwhile.","May 11, 2010"
The A.V. Club,75,"Pigeons feels less divorced from the bedroom freak-folk of the project's self-titled debut (recorded by Temple all by his lonesome, with the assistance of a looping pedal or two) than it seems the logical extension of that aesthetic. Somewhat surprisingly, especially given the debut's minor faults, the woodshedded feel of Pigeons is a good look for the band.","May 11, 2010"

New Musical Express (NME),70,"Pigeons may not be the defining moment all the blog buzz hinted at, and Luke Temple may still have several rough patches to smooth out in his songwriting process, but with Here We Go Magic's subtly enchanting second record, it sure is fun to listen to him work out the kinks.","May 11, 2010"
Urb,70,"This psychedelic folk pop-athon of tickled riffs, snappy elastic basslines, shimmering synths and sweetly sung vocals is all dreamy eccentricity, with a bittersweet hint of rhythmic unrest, from start to finish, and should send Hidden Cameras fans into an amorous tizz after just one listen.","May 11, 2010"
Tiny Mix Tapes,70,"Unlike the first record, which relied on Temple alone to fill out the layers of the songs, Pigeons utilizes the full band, and improves because of it. The songs are better composed, and more interesting: the experimental bits, which were a bit of a distraction, are more focused and purposeful.","May 11, 2010"
Drowned In Sound,70,"Temple and co. have obviously taken a big left turn that at the very least indicates a commitment to motion over stagnation; they're pushing themselves and their listeners somewhere.","May 11, 2010"
AllMusic,70,"The front-heavy momentum of Pigeons is enough to ensure that that the dreamy beauty of Here We Go Magic's debut has been fiercely preserved.","May 11, 2010"
Mojo,60,"There's nothing particularly wrong with any of this, but despite this expanded stylistic and instrumental palette (and some notably lush, lovely vocal harmonies), it's hard to escape the sense that this album is, ironically, even more of an indulgently dabbling affair than its home four-tracked predecessor, which at least had an appealing simplicity and directness of approach.","May 11, 2010"

Pitchfork,70,"The rest of Becoming a Jackal finds O'Brien blending the light and shade, allure and unease. Over these 11 songs, O'Brien maintains his intriguing vibe with spare musical arrangements (playing everything but strings and horns) and a subtle, intimate croon.","May 11, 2010"
AllMusic,69,"[O'Brien's] portentous lyrics, falsetto-prone quaver, and Simon & Garfunkel tunefulness are essential to the album's appeal.","May 11, 2010"

Paste Magazine,100,"Even though it's as ambitious an exercise in freeform genre-splicing and pure, amp-blowing volume as has been attempted in the past few years, it's always at least as fun as it is smart, taking the three great pillars of guilty-pleasure music (deafening arena-rock swagger, sugary pop hooks, and delirious dance beats) and rolling them together into a singularly appealing cacophony.","May 11, 2010"
Expert Witness (MSN Music),93,"Treats is just a whole goddamn lot of fun to listen to. It's a supremely raw and visceral pop masterwork, one appropriate to rocking out with headphones on, windows-down bumping on car stereos, four-A.M. warehouse dance parties and countless other summer moments that'll soon have soundtracks courtesy of Sleigh Bells.","May 11, 2010"
Entertainment Weekly,91,"That their most charming song by far is the straight George Clinton rip 'Rill Rill,' which leaves open the question of what they can do for an encore.

The A.V. Club,91,"It's as if every element of Sleigh Bells' genre-swerving sound--primitive guitar fuzz, pastiche beats, sugar-buzz?vocals--bypasses the default snark button and burrows?directly into jaded listeners' punch-drunk pleasure centers.","May 11, 2010"
musicOMH.com,91,"Krauss and Miller immediately reach for the jugular on nearly every track of Treats. The trick could wear thin quickly, but the tracks that previously made the Internet rounds as demos sound just as vital here as they did on first download.","May 11, 2010"
PopMatters,90,"Weighing in at just 32 minutes, Treats can hardly be accused of outstaying its welcome. In fact, its brevity is its strength - too much aural pummelling could be too much. As it is, as soon as the album finishes, you'll want to put it on again straight away.","May 11, 2010"

Absolute Punk (Staff reviews),90,"Stripping away all of the surrounding noise, it allows Krauss to bring her dizzyingly sweet voice to the fore, showing that Sleigh Bells are not just a one trick pony and that these songs work on more than just the basis that they are great at shaking windows.","May 11, 2010"
Chicago Tribune,89,"Forceful is just what is capturing about Treats. It is what makes it so hardcore to the bone. Miller puts together gritty guitar licks and hammering beats worthy of an opening slot with Ghengis Tron in my eyes and matches it to the beautiful, yet aggressive sound of Krauss' mouth.","May 11, 2010"
Pitchfork,88,"Together they create absorbingly terse songs, and prove that the indie-rock trend of minimalist, two-person bands still has some kick in it.","May 11, 2010"
Prefix Magazine,87,"The combination of the music's essentials-- jackhammer riffs clipped from punk and metal, mid-tempo beats from hip-hop and electro, and supremely catchy sing-song melodies-- is striking on its own, sounding remarkably fresh and unlike anything else right now. But an even greater source of the record's appeal is how it doesn't sound especially referential.","May 11, 2010"
cokemachineglow,85,"The best part of Treats is that it makes you rethink the possibilities of this kind of music.

Billboard.com,80,"Lidell has been through a lot in his personal life since the last album, and it seems that has prompted a rethink on his music - a turn in direction back to the less predictable, more incendiary writing of Multiply and his days with Supercollider. It suits him to be back in that place.","Jan 15, 2008"
Q Magazine,80,"Even as his piecework band stretches the sound in unexpected directions, Lidell--like a peculiar cross of Prince and Otis Redding--remains confidently true to his soul vision, creating a tense musical discourse that wrings raw emotion from each eclectic track.","Jan 15, 2008"

Prefix Magazine,75,"Lidells voice easily shifts from soul melisma to a more gruff, linear style, although several amped-up numbers (You Are Waking, Gypsy Blood) feel inert.

The Boston Phoenix,75,"While Compass, due partially to its longer track list, features a few duds that prevent it from surpassing the superior Jim, the album still shows Lidell as indies best answer to Robin Thicke and his compatriots, artists Lidell bests on a regular basis.","Jan 15, 2008"

The New York Times,70,"At times, Lidell seems determined to overcrowd his genuinely soulful and lyrically strong music, whether it's with silly, pitched-down vocals ('Your Sweet Boom'), laptoppy clicks, squiggles, and washes ('She Needs Me'), or blasts of aggro rock ('You Are Walking').","Jan 15, 2008"

Rolling Stone,70,"Even if such song structures are less conventional and more of an acquired taste than those found on Jim, there is a continuity between the two albums that will satisfy both devoted and new fans alike.

AllMusic,70,"While the ten tracks here can switch from sexy to mature, dark to funky, and the differences make themselves further known with extended listening, the heavy reliance on the synth does, unfortunately, keep that complaint intact. Omni is still a very solid record.","Oct  2, 2007"
PopMatters,70,"All the pieces that make Minus the Bear an entertaining listen are still here, but rather than experimenting with more progressive arrangements, the goal is to carefully control the mood of the album, creating a soundscape that's more restrained than anything they've ever done, but just as affecting.","Oct  2, 2007"
Kerrang!,70,"For the most, the album shows Minus the Bear tinkering very little with the sound it crafted on past releases.

Paste Magazine,70,"Laura Burhenn just smolders over a piano-heavy groove. It really is as close to Dusty as they get, but what makes this record special is the way that even when the lyrics clunk up some of the smooth blue-eyed soul (opener and sort-of title track 'What We Gained in the Fire' comes to mind), the production is so plainly gorgeous that it really feels like nitpicking (even if it really isn't).","Sep 25, 2007"

Lost At Sea,70,"The album also features songs written and sung by other Apples, and while they're perfectly pleasant indie pop, they only accentuate Schneider's mastery.","Sep 25, 2007"
Drowned In Sound,70,"Travellers appears top-heavy, with a mid-section whose only correlation to time travel is that its melodies could've felt predictable in the 1890s, with the limitations of straight 4/4 beginning to wear.

Pitchfork,70,"Last time around, the bandmembers referred to that aspect of their sound as 'post-classic rock,' though in interviews for La La Land, they declared it 'barbecue rock' instead.

New Musical Express (NME),80,"Quite who Harlem can hope to appeal to, in the UK at least, when music fans here are evidently besotted with sci-fi nonsense one minute and cleverly articulated kitchen-sink dramas the next is anyone's guess. Best to quit the questioning, though, and get down with the rollicking jams they're kicking out regardless of how many people are listening.","Sep 11, 2007"
Austin Chronicle,80,"Hippies is an uncomplicated, brilliant LP about what it's like to be young, stoned and having A REALLY GOOD TIME while not coming across like you're a complete tool.","Sep 11, 2007"
cokemachineglow,78,"With drunken charm and incessant jangle, Hippies may be Harlem's slop-pop consummation.","Sep 11, 2007"
Prefix Magazine,75,"Good songs, great times, and maybe it's a bit too long and short on variety but whatever. Plus, this record actually came out months ago and none of the songs have soured yet. That's something.","Sep 11, 2007"
No Ripcord,70,"The album has no song that truly feels like a single, and thus no particularly strong cuts ground the album.","Sep 11, 2007"
musicOMH.com,70,"Hippies is a no-frills garage-rock record that is fun and energetic, and the utter lack of pretence is a breath of fresh air in this era of overproduced corporate drivel.","Sep 11, 2007"
The A.V. Club,70,"The music on Hippies is formulaic, but in their ability to work so perfectly within a rigid aesthetic, Harlem hint at real songwriting ability.","Sep 11, 2007"
The Boston Phoenix,67,"Hippies is sloppy and likeable, but the album's tuneful, two-minute blasts of three-chord pop aren't in the least bit dangerous.","Sep 11, 2007"
PopMatters,63,"When listening to Hippies, it's difficult to forget that Harlem have professed their love for Nirvana, and still more difficult to suppress the urge to tell them to turn down that bass already.","Sep 11, 2007"
Slant Magazine,60,"You can chock the long track list up to zeal, because Harlem gives that off in spades on this album. They don't sound hidden and bored behind all the haze, but instead work their way through it, and in the end offer up a solid record with Hippies.","Sep 11, 2007"
Q Magazine,60,"In some ways Hippies recalls the bare, unassuming simplicity of three-chord punk by groups like the Ramones, and while it never attains that level of near-mindless glee, its haphazard mashing of styles creates an infectious if transient blend of songs.","Sep 11, 2007"
Delusions of Adequacy,60,"It's simple fare, true, but wholly enjoyable for it. [Jun 2010, p.124]","Sep 11, 2007"

AllMusic,88,"A little order goes a long way in making Pumps! their most accessible album to date, but what makes it their most successful album is that it still sounds like Growing.","Sep  4, 2007"
XLR8r,80,"Yeah, it's that stoney and weird, but it's also really, really good. Potentially their most accomplished work.","Sep  4, 2007"
Dusted Magazine,75,"The watery guitar parts of All the Way remain, rolled up into gritty, more linear drum-machine rhythms that occasionally give way to the serene drone of Growing's earlier years.","Sep  4, 2007"
Delusions of Adequacy,70,"The stylistic ground covered on Pumps is a logical progression for Growing and leaves them with a number of interesting places to go from here.","Sep  4, 2007"
Pitchfork,70,"Trying to isolate moments on PUMPS! proves fairly fruitless, though. Its a totally immersive experience, best approached with trust and surrender.","Sep  4, 2007"
Under The Radar,61,"Growing's approach is uncharacteristically undeveloped here, as the trio never seems to know for what exactly what it's aiming.","Sep  4, 2007"
The A.V. Club,60,"Its choppy melodic synth lead is a perfect example of how even in music this esoteric, the pop bug can still bite. And maybe that's what Pumps is, in a way-Growing's twisted vision of a pop record.","Sep  4, 2007"

AllMusic,83,"Javelin's No Mas presents 15 handmade jams that might not get the party started, but should at least sustain the hazy sunshine of 2009's 'Deadbeat Summer' through summer 2010.","Aug 28, 2007"
Dusted Magazine,80,"For the most part, the cutesiness is kept just controlled enough to make the songs intriguing.","Aug 28, 2007"
XLR8r,80,"The duo are clever producers. The album doesn't have the lopsided minimalism that's typical with the collage approach. Percussion is only as crisp as the leads and fills the spectrum evenly.","Aug 28, 2007"
Urb,80,"While the album's unique collage of what seems like vintage sounds will prompt endless 'is that a sample?' debates amongst crate diggers, the pure joy offered by just listening will hopefully reveal those arguments for what they are-beside the point.","Aug 28, 2007"
Pitchfork,80,"Javelin know what they're good at, where they stand, and they aren't trying to shove their knowledge and musical interests in their listeners faces. Instead, they let them find it for themselves by picking up on bits and pieces and carrying them forward, focusing on what interests them without having to worry about what they don't.","Aug 28, 2007"
musicOMH.com,72,"Javelin's best tracks may hold up under professional production in a year where many a group's cassette-tape flaws will likely sabotage similar leaps, but trading in their boombox for a proper stereo isn't necessarily an upgrade.","Aug 28, 2007"
Drowned In Sound,70,"Apparently, No Ms is completely sample free, with every sound painstakingly worked on to make it sound like it came from an old sample. It's this kind of logic that makes No Ms an oddly compelling listen, in the sense that you're never quite sure whether what you're hearing is amazing or awful.","Aug 28, 2007"
Under The Radar,70,"Javelin don't yet possess the same kind of wit and invention of their most obvious forbearers, but there's enormous potential here, and the biggest compliment that can be paid to No Ms is that it will sound best when reduced down to an audio tape and shoved into one of the boomboxes that Langford and van Buskirk so slavishly worship.","Aug 28, 2007"
PopMatters,70,"This tenuous house of musical cards may be scotch-taped together, but it's the exhilarating feeling that it might fold in on itself at any moment that renders it so compelling. [Spring 2010, p.70]","Aug 28, 2007"
Billboard.com,70,"It's mellow, maybe a little too mellow, but the duo seems to be okay with that. And although the layout of the tracks flows in and out of consciousness and doesn't really take the record anywhere specific, it is considerably cohesive.","Aug 28, 2007"
The Boston Phoenix,68,"On their second release No Mas, cousins George Langford and Tom Van Buskirk stake their claim in the world of electronica with an everything-but-the-kitchen-sink approach, yielding infectious but often mind-boggling results.","Aug 28, 2007"
No Ripcord,63,"The duo can't possibly keep up this kind of frivolous pace, and several of the 15 tracks are just (and I apologize for using the term) chillwave jams--but nearly all are expertly crafted, and hedged with mirthy dance flavor.","Aug 28, 2007"
Tiny Mix Tapes,60,"In lengthening the song lengths and trimming the tracklist, No Mas jettisons the spontaneous, off-the-cuff energy that made their debut so incredibly fun.","Aug 28, 2007"
AllMusic,50,"No Ms has three-fifths as many tracks in the same amount of time [as Jamz n Jemz], and for the most part, each track outstays its welcome.","Aug 28, 2007"

Dusted Magazine,90,"Starting with demo versions of 'For Ex-Lovers Only' and 'Throw Aggi Off the Bridge' that are enjoyably scraggly if not as overwhelming as the final takes. The remaining four consist of new recordings by the original band, though they're not new songs; instead, they're selections from their irregular live sets that were never formally recorded and released at the time. The production style makes it sound like they were recorded at the same time as the rest of the disc, making it a seamless treat.","Aug 28, 2007"
musicOMH.com,90,"Their pithy discography--a kind of ur-record of indie-pop, ripped off knowingly and unknowingly--is part of their magic.","Aug 28, 2007"
No Ripcord,90,"Black Tambourine have finally gotten the treatment they deserve. This is essential listening for anyone who wonders where indie-rock's been, or where it's going. The influence is obvious, and the music has never sounded better.","Aug 28, 2007"
PopMatters,90,"The narratives it employs are true to life, the reverb drenched instrumentation was rightfully summoned, and the substitution of dark undertones over lighter sensibilities that such genre was commonly known for were ditched with good reason. No wonder Slumberland has wholeheartedly embraced Black Tambourine's influence to their label. That's good enough reason to bring another of independent music's long forgotten cult stories into the forefront.","Aug 28, 2007"
Pitchfork,90,"Black Tambourine is indispensable listening for anyone with even a passing interest in indie pop's past or current renaissance and a wholly welcome reminder of the unwavering greatness of one of the genre's truly seminal bands.","Aug 28, 2007"
Paste Magazine,83,"That Complete Recordings has long gone out of print makes Black Tambourine an essential acquisition for current In the Red, Woodsist, and Slumberland loyalists. And even for old-school adherents, the bonus tracks included warrant a repurchase.","Aug 28, 2007"
Austin Chronicle,73,"Black Tambourine can be amateurish: 'Can't Explain' seems as if it's being held together with chewed-up licorice and broken guitar strings. But it also builds to a fine frenzy that fans of Vivian Girls will find pleasantly familiar.","Aug 28, 2007"
AllMusic,67,"Even the tape warp of the demos sounds like it was done on purpose. The packaging gets updated, too, with liner notes pondering how so many current bands have added BT's sound 'to their own DNA.' A rare gem that still holds up.","Aug 28, 2007"

Slant Magazine,70,"Produced by the band itself, these songs help bridge the gap between Annuals two full-length albums, taking their wild eclecticism from 'Be He Me' but keeping the melodies that anchored 'Such Fun.'","Aug 28, 2007"
cokemachineglow,70,"If such a broad spectrum of influences suggests a wicked case of ADHD, it also keeps Sweet Sister compelling for its entire duration, which isn't the backhanded compliment it might seem to be.","Aug 28, 2007"
Pitchfork,60,"Heres hoping Sweet Sister is the sound of a talented group shaking out some superficial songwriting ideas before getting down to it.","Aug 28, 2007"
PopMatters,56,"The lyrics' yearning for something tangible and substantial ultimately feels at odds with what Sweet Sister, promising surface and all, actually brings to the table.","Aug 28, 2007"
Under The Radar,50,"Billed as a move back to an indie label (Banter, in this case) and a return to form, this five-track EP aims itself squarely between the two full-lengths, yet it still doesnt find the correct balance.","Aug 28, 2007"
Alternative Press,50,"Sweet Sister isn't as saccharine as one might expect. [Winter 2010, p.71]","Aug 28, 2007"
Drowned In Sound,40,"This North Carolina sextet's satisfying angst gets replaced with tinny keyboard effects and Guster-ready bongo drums. With every song, vocakist Adam Baker oozes further into an imaginary indie-lite Pixar flick. [May 2010, p.102]","Aug 28, 2007"

musicOMH.com,80,"Coconut, then, is a baffling, dirty, even exhausting listen at times, but never less than engaging throughout.","Aug 28, 2007"
PopMatters,80,"Archie Bronson Outfit have hovered on the fringes of success for some time now, somehow never quite achieving the success that their critical acclaim would suggest they deserve. Coconut may be a bit too obtuse to change that, but it's a fascinating release; for those willing to explore beneath the seemingly obtuse surface, there's much to delight.","Aug 28, 2007"
Uncut,80,"Perhaps partly due to production by DFAs Tim Goldsworthy, this time around its more honed and well-rounded.","Aug 28, 2007"
New Musical Express (NME),80,"Cacophonous, chaitic, and a lot of fun. [Apr 2010, p.83]","Aug 28, 2007"

Absolute Punk (Staff reviews),90,"Ably coaxed on and assembled by Ward--whose input ought not to be overlooked--Volume Two is an outstanding collection of tracks worthy of any discerning listener's undivided attention.","Aug 21, 2007"
Entertainment Weekly,85,"In the end, Volume Two is a showcase of Deschanels and Wards best traits--Wards production and composition and Deschanels intelligence and magnetism.","Aug 21, 2007"
The A.V. Club,83,"Though Ward is a master instrumentalist, Deschanel's vocal affects and childlike rhymes sometimes veer into twee overload; she can seem too in love with her own adorability. But by a cappella closer ''If You Can't Sleep,'' it's hard to begrudge this Volume's magpie charms.","Aug 21, 2007"
Filter,83,"Save for the occasional song seemingly arranged by rote, Volume Two delivers the expected sweetness, but on a grander scale than the duos debut.","Aug 21, 2007"
Billboard.com,82,"Volume Two sees the return of She & Him and with fantastic results. Any shyness surrounding Deschanels songwriting on the first record has melted away, and here she is unabashed, graceful and poignant. Ward has followed suit, fleshing out the production canvas right along with Deschanel's ever-growing gusto.","Aug 21, 2007"
AllMusic,82,"As on Volume One, Ward's performance and production excel, and his song arrangements move effortlessly between heart-rending and cheery.While Ward's musicianship remains the magic behind She & Him, Deschanel's lyrical growth on Volume Two proves she can hold her own alongside a well-respected partner.","Aug 21, 2007"
Alternative Press,80,"Like the previous album, Volume 2 would suffer under the weight of its own pastiche if it werent so darn endearing, filled as it is with call-and-response vocals, studio reverb, sweeping orchestrations, and other bygone tricks of the trade.","Aug 21, 2007"
Drowned In Sound,80,"Volume Two, as its title announces, succeeds  Volume One's charming, old-timey sensibility, relying again in Deschanel's sweet croon to augment the already inviting tracks. [Apr 2010, p.130]","Aug 21, 2007"
The New York Times,80,"She & Him treat what could be needless and indulgent with care and soul. Volume Two will surprise and charm in equal measure.","Aug 21, 2007"

Under The Radar,Volume Two (Merge)By Paul Terefenko,"Aug 21, 2007"
Pitchfork,Welcome to Volume 2, the second release by cute-as-a-button Zooey Deschanel and quirky romance-soundtrack-meister M. Ward, aka She & Him.,"Aug 21, 2007"


AllMusic,Its largely a continuation of Volume One, so if Deschanels occasionally off-putting intonation isnt too much for you, this sweet romp through a warm, largely carefree universe should nestle naturally into your listening rotation.","Aug 21, 2007"
Filter,78,"Although too saccharine in places, She & Him's second time around spins wonderfully bittersweet.","Aug 21, 2007"
No Ripcord,76,"What makes the album so distinctive isn't just the sound of her voice, the quality of her songwriting, or even the resourcefulness of his arrangements, but their joint insistence that these old sounds have as much to say nowadays as they ever did.","Aug 21, 2007"
Drowned In Sound,75,"Like its predecessor, Volume II stands outside current production trends, and its built to last on its own modest terms.","Aug 21, 2007"
BBC Music,70,"It's the sunniest sad record you'll hear all year--pretty love songs set in a 'nation' where summer never ends.","Aug 21, 2007"
musicOMH.com,70,"Sweet without being stupid, She & Him have once again managed to flaunt both brains and beauty. [Winter 2010, p.65]","Aug 21, 2007"
Delusions of Adequacy,70,"She plays the dewy-eyed ingnue a bit too faithfully at times, but there is no denying her legitimacy as a tunesmith, divvying her set between bouncy piano-pop, folk-flavored sing-alongs and orchestral anthems.","Aug 21, 2007"
Spin,60,"The smiling-through-tears undercurrent of 60s pop is lost in Deschanels taffy-like vocals, and though the album evokes memories of a more pleasant time, they seem far too sweet to be real.","Aug 21, 2007"
Billboard.com,60,"Volume Two feels better than it could be, but it's still missing that something that would make it great.","Aug 21, 2007"
PopMatters,60,"Their vision is charming and lovely and idiosyncratic, but their slavish devotion to their mission statement is starting to feel like an anchor on their talent.","Aug 21, 2007"
Urb,60,"Where Volume One was strongest was simply the quality of the songs (try getting Why Do You Let Me Stay Here? out of your head in a hurry), yet theres something sadly lacking about Volume Two, and what previously sounded like finely-crafted homage is now often more like impotent pastiche.","Aug 21, 2007"
Q Magazine,60,"Mostly this is the swingingest easy-listening country you can shake a cocktail at. [May 2010, p.127]","Aug 21, 2007"
NOW Magazine,60,"Once again, Daschanel demonstrates a deep understanding and irony-free love of innocent, old-school pop craft in her writing, but too many of the chorus hooks pass by without sticking, and aome of the stacked-up vocal arrangements sag under their own weight. [May 2010, p.102]","Aug 21, 2007"
cokemachineglow,51,"Volume Two is a record, of occasional charm, that comes off all-too-aware of how cranky a response to it other than charming will seem.","Aug 21, 2007"
Dusted Magazine,50,"Sometimes Volume Two drifts in a Valium haze of deep sighs, or its lyrics wanly drain the fun out of romance.","Aug 21, 2007"
Prefix Magazine,50,"In his solo work, Ward's songs have exhibited a kind of arcane gritty lyricism: They're false museum pieces, revivifying old notions of garage-sale Americana, but they have heart and feel at least partially lived in. There's very little of that here, and though it's hard to hate Volume Two, it's also far too easy to forget it.","Aug 21, 2007"
The A.V. Club,50,"As impressively specific as those sonic ideas are, though, Deschanel's songwriting here is less distinctive than it was on 'Volume One.' Too many of the tracks bleed together in a well-appointed mush of major-minor melodies and hand-me-down lyrics about the inevitability of heartbreak.","Aug 21, 2007"
Pitchfork,40,"Rather than being something different or a step in a new direction, it's merely a continuation of the same thing as last time. [Winter 2010, p.65]","Aug 21, 2007"

AllMusic,84,"That we're still able to observe the funloving side of the band while also getting to see that there's more to them than that is what makes Two Thousand and Ten Injuries such a charmer. That their compositions sound more precisely constructed and flat-out better this time out doesn't hurt either.","Aug 21, 2007"

Uncut,80,"On its third album, the group doesnt so much tone this down as weave these elements into a more elaborate and adventurous record.","Aug 21, 2007"
PopMatters,80,"Good as a heartbreak-balm, an above-average way to spend a night in bed or just something to dance with your special lady / man / whatever to, Love is All's latest proves that they can be counted on to bring quality pop, no matter what.","Aug 21, 2007"
Delusions of Adequacy,80,"With Two Thousand and Ten Injuries Love Is All have created another master class in yearning, defiant, confused and lovelorn indie-pop, the sort of record you wish you had by your side when you were stuck re-heating cheeseburger puffs* for minimum wage in one of Essexs premier petrol station.","Aug 21, 2007"
Drowned In Sound,80,"This is a great album: smart, thrilling, bouncy, imaginative, sussed, melodic, fiery, punchy, passionate, repetitive, and immersed in the technology of 2010 but the ideology of the 60s and late 70s (and early 90s Olympia, if were going to be exact).","Aug 21, 2007"

No Ripcord,50,"Love Is All have turned down the sax, exchanging many of their former bursts of spunk for half an album thats tighter and more heartbreakingly anthemic, and a remainder that drifts into directionless tedium.","Aug 21, 2007"

Tiny Mix Tapes,75,"Sure, this record doesn't quite match their best work, on 2002's ...and the Surrounding Mountains, but it is just as strong as anything else in their discography.","Aug 21, 2007"
AllMusic,75,"The record spins the mood that Radar Bros. fans have come to expect: that feeling of being happily sunbaked and mildly delirious, subsisting on pure sensory intake.","Aug 21, 2007"
Drowned In Sound,70,"The 'Americana' tag sticks thanks to the general country-rock tropes and all the natural imagery, but as usual the group excels at blurring the edges of an already blurry genre with spacey (but never indulgent) psych leanings, controls set for the heart of the sun but anchored comfortably down to earth.","Aug 21, 2007"
Uncut,60,"There's no arguing Putnam has a genuine talent for writing melodies and giving them shape in the studio, but he needs to add more colors to his palate if he expects people to come back to hear the same tale again and again.","Aug 21, 2007"

The A.V.

These tracks, along with 'On Giving Up' and 'Constant Winter,' undeniably signal High Places' shift toward a more accessible sound, but they also happen to be some of the brightest spots on the album.","Aug 21, 2007"
Drowned In Sound,70,"Rob Barber intensifies the band's trademark polyrhythms with snappy post-punk bass and eerie dub echoes on disco-leaning tracks like 'On Giving Up,' while singer Mary Pearson eschews lyrics about happy trees for stories of loneliness and alienation.","Aug 21, 2007"

AllMusic,60,"Mankind across as the next step in defining who High Places are, instead of the sort of developmental stopgap that makes us wonder why we ever believed internet hype in the first place.","Aug 21, 2007"
Dusted Magazine,50,"If you heard Mankind without hearing their other work, you might think it was a decent record with a couple of memorable songs--kind of generic and bland, but not awful.

cokemachineglow,40,"I'm all about brevity when it's effective, but S-M 2's patchiness makes its 38-minute length feel much longer.

Filter,80,"The record's songs maintain Oldham's characteristic simplicity and sparseness that hearken back to the now ancient songs of American music's past.

Drowned In Sound,80,"Youre hearing an overall group, overall sound, an hourlong unity.

Uncut,90,"What makes Broken Bells such a compelling body of work is undeniably the result of the broad range of sounds that fill its palette.

Billboard.com,75,"Little wonder that their 'Broken Bells' (Columbia) project, on which they play all the instruments, packs 11 meticulously orchestrated songs into less than 38 minutes.

Los Angeles Times,60,"'high Road' is melodic enough, for sure, and Mercer is a clear-voiced singer, but the album's interest palls when Mouse's answer to life, the universe and everything proves to be 'pedestrian breakbeat.' [Apr 2010, p.83]","Jul 24, 2007"
Paste Magazine,60,"The High Road and Vaporize are exactly what you would expect: exquisite collisions of Murphy's masterful, slightly winsome melodies and Danger Mouse's sonic skills, as also applied to Gorillaz, Beck and Gnarls Barkley. However, elsewhere the pair  who met in 2004 and have been talking about working together ever since  form too much of a mutual appreciation society to push each other beyond their comfort zones.","Jul 24, 2007"
PopMatters,60,"The pace is so chilled it would make a trip-hopper give up valium, and once past Vaporise it's hard to take much notice. You suddenly find yourself at track seven, and don't remember what's come before. Things do pick up again towards the end, although by now the debt owed to other artists is piling up.","Jul 24, 2007"
Filter,60,"Broken Bells is clearly a mood record, but even with so many textures, resources and talent, it all hits one stilted note. Either this is an indicator of where the temporarily Shin-less Mercer is headed or its little more than a curious footnote on his and Burton's careers.","Jul 24, 2007"
cokemachineglow,50,"At its very best, when the collaboration clicks, Broken Bells boasts some truly marvelous songs, but these peaks are sandwiched between tracks that struggle to exceed colorless tedium.","Jul 24, 2007"

Austin Chronicle,80,"Musically, too, there's a definite sense of progression.

Alternative Press,66,"'Midnight Organ Fight' announced with its title that its underlying concern was sex (not getting it, not getting it from who you want, being unfulfilled by it), and the songs on this new album, though more lyrically complex, seem neutered by comparison.","Jul 24, 2007"
The Guardian,65,"Although the album is listenable and even uplifting at times, no songs readily stand out as particularly important or poignant in the way that Keep Yourself Warm or Old Old Fashioned from The Midnight Organ Fight do.","Jul 24, 2007"
Uncut,60,"His proud croon and the band's surging folk rock mean the emotional effect is closer to rebirth than suicide, but by the time the fourth song to feature a metaphorical drowning rolls around, the string parts start to matter more than the sentiments, which was probably not the intent.","Jul 24, 2007"

Rock Sound,90,"Some of the riffs are quite incredible ('A More Perfect Union'), and the general effect of the whole album is that the listener will want to weep and dance simultaneously. Simply brilliant.","Jul 24, 2007"
Slant Magazine,90,"The Monitor, then, is a boisterous, eloquent argument that rock music need not be dumb in order to be enjoyable, moreover, that we should be questioning and analysing our heritage rather than precariously stumbling onwards.

Rolling Stone,89,"The Monitor is a near perfect union of cacophony and immature angst.","Jul 24, 2007"
PopMatters,88,"Typically the band can be found tiptoeing the edge of shameless, binge-drinking punk rock ('Titus Andronicus Forever'). It's better when they're loud, I think, because it makes Stickles' doubt seem more immediate, like there's a time limit to his sanity.","Jul 24, 2007"

Slant Magazine,81,"The Monitor is ridiculously strident and frequently overblown, but somehow never slips into self-parody, which may only be true because it's obvious these guys are having a total blast indulging this hard.

Clash Music,80,"this passionate record sounds more true to the E Street Band's spirit than do the absurdly literal Bossisms of the Gaslight Anthem.

Paste Magazine,75,"That means you get Stickles roaring about being told he'll always be a loser over full-throttle indie-Springsteen arrangements replete with bleating Clarence Clemons saxophone lines, pavement-pounding marching-band drums, and loads of drunk-dude Dropkick Murphys gang-vocal chants.","Jul 24, 2007"

cokemachineglow,70,"It lasts about two days, though, and even though the likes of 'Four Score And Seven' and 'To Old Friends And New' hum with energy and shoutalong choruses a little restraint would've worked wonders. An above-average Titus record is worth a dozen imitators, though.","Jul 24, 2007"

No Ripcord,70,"The occasional overlong segment of a song (The Battle Of Hampton Roads) and self-pitying tone and vocal that skate a little close to 'emo' (No Future Part Three...) are really the only complaints that can be levelled.

PopMatters,70,"Lyrically, history and modern anxiety morph into freedom songs for an age where, then as now, 'the enemy is everywhere,' and neither whiskey nor 'a pretty good GPA' will save you. But an album this excellent just might.","Jul 24, 2007"
Tiny Mix Tapes,60,"Neither a home run, then, nor the dreaded sophomore slump, The Monitor is, it is probably more fair to say, the album that finds the band maturing beyond the precocious triumph of their debut by first having to pass through their awkward, gangly adolescent phase.","Jul 24, 2007"
Drowned In Sound,59,"At times the running-on-fumes punk benefits The Monitor's overall sound.

Sputnikmusic,40,"The execution here might have seemed a bit more authentic had they been going for a pure concept album with a Civil War theme; unfortunately, hearing Stickles locked in bloodied-but-unbowed mode throughout the record doesn't add any greater emotional depth to the intertwining themes.","Jul 24, 2007"

Alternative Press,80,"This mysterious Swedish dream-pop band's music remains hazy--mucho echo, blurry harmonies, soft acoustic instrumentation buoyed by generous synth strings, and a bright white ambience suggesting both sunny Balearic beaches and blinding Scandinavian snowstorms. Yet its emotions are conversely vivid.","Jul 24, 2007"
Delusions of Adequacy,80,"It feels like a genuine use of the source material; not even as something conscious, like a person that travels around hoping to find new sounds, but rather as an act of dialectical eruption--the past naturally coming back in a different form.","Jul 24, 2007"

Spin,60,"On the one hand, no 3 can sound frustrating unfinished. It seems as though something substantially more satisfying would have been attained had the band just stuck with it for a while longer.

NOW Magazine,60,"It's a precision attack, and as lofty and lovely as these tunes can sound, even their note-perfect nature seems to hold the listener at arm's length.

The Guardian,60,"The places where the album feels awkward or overdone do not erase the general sense that Kurosky has returned with a sense of determination. As an album, The Desert of Shallow Effects feels not like a lark, but like a mission.","Jul 17, 2007"

PopMatters,100,"Hidden is not just the most original record to emerge from Britain this year, but the most unfathomable: an immaculate enigma.","Jul 10, 2007"
Hot Press,100,"You know, deep down, that the These New Puritans set is the one that you'll be listening to in a decade, enjoying the fact that you can never quite decipher its codes, and probably being amazed at how many more commercially successful records it inspired.","Jul 10, 2007"
Spin,90,"Showing clear progression and monumental ambition, TNP have crafted a stark and dense knockout performance.","Jul 10, 2007"

The New York Times,89,"Seldom have classical delicacy, rock attitude and pop vitality coexisted with such improbable ease.","Jul 10, 2007"
AllMusic,82,"Hidden is a strikingly inventive and original rock record. Granted, nothing is ever completely new in pop music, but the album freshly synthesizes older ideas (post-rock textures, no-wave skronk, Steve Reich-influenced phasing) and current trends (dubstep's delay, chart pop's stentorian synth lines, global beats).","Jul 10, 2007"
Under The Radar,80,"Barnett's blue-sky dreaming is actually a pretty accurate description of Hidden  heavily beat-driven, almost entirely absent of guitars, and laced with large amounts of elaborately arranged woodwind and brass. Does it work? Largely, yes.","Jul 10, 2007"

PopMatters,80,"Ultimately, Hidden is the sound of an ambitious young band as eager to use every tool at its disposal as it is to avoid studiously doing what's been done before.","Jul 10, 2007"
Slant Magazine,80,"Here we are not even two years later and the band has taken a huge leap forward. Or, more accurately, sideways. Nothing in the angular post-punk of 08's Beat Pyramid suggested the band was capable of something this novel.","Jul 10, 2007"

The Guardian,70,"Whatever its flaws, Hidden stands as a bracingly original statement from a band entirely too new to have this many good ideas. Come December, it may not make any 'best of' lists, but it's certainly one of the most fascinating albums we're likely to see this year.","Jul 10, 2007"

Pitchfork,70,"The production, songs, and vocals are all perfectly in tune with each other, and the band has crafted a pretty impressive return to form.

Q Magazine,70,"Although the Oakland, California-based outfit bookends the record with lo-fi charm--the free-spirited Solitary Gun and stripped-bare All That Remains--Permalight also uncharacteristically departs into euphoric yet contrived electro-pop.","Jul 10, 2007"
PopMatters,67,"The Auto-Tuned vocals and cluttered background instrumentation on the title track represents a low point of the album. Luckily, the second half of 'Permalight' moves away from electronics and finds Rogue Wave returning to its guitar-based, head-nodding roots.","Jul 10, 2007"
Delusions of Adequacy,65,"In the three years since Rogue Waves last album, frontman Zach Rogue has discovered the synthesizer. This isnt bad in theory, but in practice the newfound instrument does little to lift Rogue Wave to the next level.","Jul 10, 2007"

musicOMH.com,50,"Overproduction ultimately damns this record as much as anything, with everything cranked to 11 and Rogues voice constantly reverbed. Permalight sounds like a band whos incredibly eager to impress, which wasnt how Rogue emerged on the scene, a singer of simple pop songs.","Jul 10, 2007"
Q Magazine,50,"Permalight is a startling contrast in subdued grace and awkward severity, alternately rewarding and punishing as the band seeks to craft a new voice without entirely abandoning the old.","Jul 10, 2007"

AllMusic,80,"Fight Softly is, while not a game-changer, certainly a level-raiser. It glistens with pop immediacy, rollicks with breathtaking percussive interpositions, and clatters to a beat entirely of its own construct.","Jul 10, 2007"
BBC Music,80,"Yet despite the gadgetry that went into the albums production, Fight Softly is still a sunny piece of work, filled with gorgeous pop melodies that are complex but rarely challenging.","Jul 10, 2007"

No Ripcord,72,"While rarely graceless and often impressive (Two Humans, worth noting, develops into something sexy before going for broke), everything on Fight Softly just seems too much. Theres a lot thats pretty here--but theres a lot.","Jul 10, 2007"

Under The Radar,70,"While their third album, Fight Softly, hasn't quite hit on anything new under the shimmering pop sun, it's a capable display of borrowing and synthesizing that should help to differentiate the Suns from complacent trend-followers who draw on similar influences.","Jul 10, 2007"
Dusted Magazine,70,"But for all the labels and feelings the album conjures and provokes, Fight Softly ends up sounding like a bunch of beats and blips gesticulating wildly instead of a cohesive body of melodies and songs.","Jul 10, 2007"
PopMatters,61,"It's a true departure in sound and method; this is not a lazy or complacent record. McPhun, though, never settles into these new sounds, and Fight Softly retains very little of the ease and abandon that, to date, had marked the Ruby Suns.","Jul 10, 2007"

PopMatters,60,"While hardly acting as a complete departure from previous efforts, the Ruby Suns third outing regrettably cuts itself off at the knees too often to be considered either progressive or a total success.","Jul 10, 2007"
RapReviews.com,50,"Surprisingly enough, it lacks a strong sense of focus (something the creative basking of Sea Lion honed in on) and for all of its elements of sweeping grandiosity, they never seem to have much of a purpose.","Jul 10, 2007"

New Musical Express (NME),90,"Strange Boys are not revivalists, and they're not out of touch. Instead, they offer exactly the kind of rock 'n' roll slap in the face we need in this angular, post-modern 2010. The garage hasn't sounded this good in a long time.","Jul 10, 2007"
Alternative Press,80,"The sound is richer and the mood conveyed by Sambol--think a Muppet Show Sylan--is more rueful. [Apr 2010, p.121]","Jul 10, 2007"

Drowned In Sound,75,"They could have retread the same musical territory, but instead they deliver a record thats remarkable in its maturity and--most of all--its ability to be replayed again and again.","Jul 10, 2007"
Urb,70,"With songs like All You Can Hide Inside revealing a flair for rough-around-the-edges ballads, Be Brave shows that the Strange Boys are growing--not in a self-consciously mature way, but enough to make them more than just purveyors of raffish garage rock.","Jul 10, 2007"
Tiny Mix Tapes,70,"Be Brave is not quite the barnstormer that its lead single suggests, but there is enough gumption to see The Strange Boys through any scrutiny of their credentials.","Jul 10, 2007"
Pitchfork,70,"Tellingly, Be Brave is back-loaded with easily the strongest and most diverse cuts, and by the time the final acoustic plucks of You Cant Only Love When You Want fade out, The Strange Boys have done almost a sonic 180.","Jul 10, 2007"
cokemachineglow,70,"The only thing letting The Strange Boys down this time is a lack of vivacity. Their attitude is dripping from every song, but occasionally youll find yourself wanting them to blow their top, to unleash the energy they seem to be capping throughout for the sake of melody.","Jul 10, 2007"
Pitchfork,70,"Theres an intriguing, never pandering, blend of genres on Be Bravefrom soul to blues to modern day indie rock-packaged as Texas bluesmaking the record a more interesting listen each time around.","Jul 10, 2007"
PopMatters,70,"Reviewed as a whole album though, it must concede that buying Be Brave would be like paying for two songs played at different speeds and in different keys fourteen times over, an unwise choice that would eventually leave many wondering just what the hell is so different between Friday in Paris and Da Da anyway? I've got to tell you, after these past couple days, I can barely even tell anymore.","Jul 10, 2007"

Drowned In Sound,60,"Ryan Sambol, with his nasal drawl and ready harmonica, is perhaps rather too into Dylan for comfort, but the title track is dispatched with skronky brio, and 'The Unsent Letter' is a heartfelt piano ballad all cracked with emotion. [Apr 2010, p.100]","Jul 10, 2007"

musicOMH.com,50,"Their greatest undoing comes from slouching toward completion. So much of their debut worked because it lacked finish. The holes in the record were where the charm oozed most freely.

BBC Music,88,"It takes a liner note and lyric look-along to absorb the full dose, but 'Marvin' clicks immediately. Same goes for the thoughtfully morbid 'Border Crossing' and 'Kitchen Sink,' on which Dolan throws everything from introspection to a wee bit of bounce.","Jul  9, 2007"
Clash Music,80,"He's aided in this task by Anticon genius Alias, who produced the entire record--his spastic, head-nodding beats are so good, that they occasionally overshadow the headliner.

New Musical Express (NME),80,"Whatever magic Eric B. and Rakim had is nothing compared to B. Dolan and Alias. In a world growing more cynical by the day, Fallen House, Sunken City is a beacon of hope, as empowering and cerebral as it is worthy of bumping and grinding.","Jul  9, 2007"
PopMatters,40,"Alias's production merely compounds the record's dense and oppressive aesthetic. The tracks tend to bleed into each other musically, one grainy backing indistinguishable from the next.","Jul  9, 2007"

Uncut,70,"If you can take Hologram Jams lightly and come to terms with the fact that Jaguar Loves post-punk and rock pretenses are fully behind them, then its a fun outing. Ridiculous lyrics, bristling energy, 80s synths, and booty beats are the core of the record.","Apr 11, 2006"
musicOMH.com,70,"Glossing over realisations that the second half begins to drag, Hologram Jams wont appease anybody who rates music to decimal points or regularly orders their record collection alphabetically.

Rolling Stone,90,"Hot Chips newfound sonic focus pays off, and with each record the band feels more like the five-piece that it now is instead of just the initial songwriting nucleus of Goddard and lead vocalist Alexis Taylor.

PopMatters,75,"The best bits of Eyelid Movies show range and attention to detail, so it's hard to care when they downshift into waves of serpentine sound. Eyelid Movies is a sumptuous, seductive record, easy to let fall into the background, sure, but easier still to fall into.","Mar 21, 2006"
The New York Times,70,"Eyelid Movies is a nostalgia trip at heart, but it isnt a lifeless pastiche by any means. The amount of care the duo gives to the arrangements, the subtle and successful blending of influences, and above all, the high quality of the songs and performances, mean that the record is a success on its own terms.","Mar 21, 2006"
AllMusic,70,"Eyelid Movies does what good albums ought to do: it fabricates a little musical universe, complete with its own weather (cold fog, blistering sun), settings (seedy clubs in the San Fernando Valley, the backseats of black cars), and moods (paranoia, sexual ecstasy, hungover ennui).","Mar 21, 2006"
Mojo,70,"It should be noted that Eyelid Movies owes a great deal to Portishead's entire catalogue in terms of song structure, phrasing, and instrumentation.

Paste Magazine,60,"From the hip-hop loops and grungy, Dust Brothers-style synths of 'Running from the Cops,' to the new wave balladry of 'All Dried Up,' and the trip-hop cool of 'You Are the Ocean,' these are kinds of left-of-center pop tunes that, in the mid-'90s, could have sneaked their way onto Top 40 and modern-rock playlists (which were basically the same thing back then).","Mar 21, 2006"
Pitchfork,55,"The skills Barthel and Carter possess at creating this kind of sound with just a keyboard and guitar, as well as the two bandmate's longtime personal chemistry, points to a promising future.

NOW Magazine,60,"Sure, the electro-pop leanings on Paper Dolls may sap their songs of some of the dreamy haze they had before, but in its place we get an immediate brightness to this collection, one that doesnt fade with repeat plays.

New Musical Express (NME),64,"Not every song here is successful, and as far as innovation goes, Grubbs isn't going to be driving the conversation, but he's put out a pleasing pop record that leaves listeners with no reason to absolutely despise the channel. [Winter 2010, p.99]","Nov  8, 2005"
Rock Sound,50,"Grubbs comes one step closer to turning Almost Everything I Wish Id Said into the underground equivalent of Parachutes 'Losing Sleep' or the Frays 'How to Save a Life.' He doesn't quite get there, perhaps, but the attempt still has some tuneful moments.","Nov  8, 2005"

The Boston Phoenix,80,"Their aim is to make 'music that sounds so dated it doesn't date', and on their debut they've fulfilled the brief. Unicorn is 32 minutes of the bippety-boppety electro sounds that defined 2009, making it feel both contemporary(ish) and retro, with the fleshy vocals of one-name singer Tigs comprising the selling point.","Nov  8, 2005"

Billboard.com,60,"Sadly theres only one track here where singer Tigs urgent purr and the subtle combination of electronica and bouncy indie pop matches either of those two tracks: the mesmeric Slick.

Drowned In Sound,80,"What primarily sets Romance Is Boring up as a significant step forward is that its incredibly structurally cohesive, and yet blows anything theyve previously released out of the water in terms of textural intricacy, technical prowess and general experimentation; each track seems to take an element thats been formerly alluded to and stretch it to a fuller form.","Nov  1, 2005"

PopMatters,70,"Lacking many new moves, Romance doesn't feel as revelatory as Los Campesinos' killer 2008 debut.

Clash Music,70,"As much as anything, the record seems to be about holding the dark at bay, with stabbing riffs that jut at odd angles into the void, with frantic, interlocked rhythms that echo over silent spaces, with dance-syncopated sing-songs darting and fading into impenetrable gloom.","Oct 25, 2005"
PopMatters,61,"Icy and stiff has been the band's M.O., but its new material demands performances that command that sparseness rather than toy with it.

Uncut,76,"Citay remain controlled and careful. Songs are constructed so that each line plays a certain role, every note tells its tale. Maybe that's where it will lose some listeners, too: It's not tough and rough and wild around the edges like Green's old band could be, or a lot of heavy metal can be. And it's not open at the ends like jam-band music.

Tiny Mix Tapes,60,"One's enjoyment of Dream Get Together will depend greatly upon their appreciation for good jam sessions.

The A.V.

Pitchfork,60,"'Ludow St' is lyrically smart, musically ambitious, more than any other track on Phrazes, it makes you wonder, if not regret, why the Strokes themselves never pushed the boat out this far.

Prefix Magazine,55,"The irony is that Phrazes for the Young is so smoothed over--nearly all of Casablancas' trademark vocal roughness is airbrushed into oblivion--it instantly sounds like a plexiglass-covered museum piece.","Sep 27, 2005"
Drowned In Sound,50,"With the Strokes, Casablancas exploits the tension between his behind-the-beat, just-woke-up vocals and the bands hurtling rhythms.

Dusted Magazine,75,"Look, if youre seeking out the latest flavor of the month or are looking to see where this chillwave shit is going, Love Comes Close is probably not high on your list.

The New York Times,20,"Built off of two piano chords or a single guitar riff, Felix'a music is as ho-hum as their vocals, and without diversity in the songs' chord structure, the album blurs together until what's left is a coffee-table coaster. [Dec 2009, p.113]","Sep 27, 2005"

NOW Magazine,80,"Cox is evidently a songwriter and sound sculptor of incredible skill and though the inclusion of the two collaborations--both a little too in thrall to their guests perhaps--means Logos lacks the wholly immersive quality of its predecessor, there is little else to contest; truly, this is pop music at its most weird and wonderful.","Sep 20, 2005"

Boston Globe,70,"This darker, heavier tone makes the majority of Kill less of a party than 'Fire' or 'I Shall Exterminate Everything Around Me That Restricts Me from Being the Master,' but splendidly, Dance Commander rears his head to make demands like 'Shake that tambourine/Shake that shaking machine!' in 'Egyptian Cowboy' and encourages mass consumption in the splendid 'Body Shot,' which devolves from a grunge-disco jam into a wonderful, dubbed-out frenzy.","Sep 13, 2005"

Pitchfork,70,"While there's no shortage of stylistic/historical touchstones for the wildly varied batch of tracks that makes up Rites, there's some indefinable thread connecting it all, ultimately giving the band members their own sound whether they really want one or not.","Mar 22, 2005"
Rolling Stone,60,"Full of craft and purpose, enchanting and creative, Rites is a promising tease of better things to come.","Mar 22, 2005"

Village Voice (Consumer Guide),88,"This Seattle wunderkind trio's debut full-length arrives like a freaky reward from a cosmos that has watched us persevere through 15 years of tightening jeans, steadily ramping foppism, and the crushingly beige influence of adult-contempo alt-country.","Mar 22, 2005"
Wall of Sound,70,"Repetitive, psyche-battering noise obscures things--most of the songs sound like there was a jackhammer nearby during recording--yet, after a couple of times through, its easy enough to discern pop hooks.","Mar 22, 2005"

Boston Globe,80,"The core idea brings a bright focus and forward movement to their gummy, ambrosial stoner sound, adding bright melody and fairytale zing to these end-of-summer tales of beachbound escape and smalltown torpor. [Nov 2009, p.101]","Mar 22, 2005"

The Boston Phoenix,70,"They are not in tune with trends, or even an aesthetic, so much as something earthier...the seasons perhaps, because theres no denying that Gorgeous Johnny has a latitude and a longitude... its the sound of a fading summer.","Mar 22, 2005"
NOW Magazine,50,"In the end there are too few of those evocative moments, and Gorgeous Johnny ends up coming off as a less than inviting album.","Mar 22, 2005"
Spin,48,"The bulk of Gorgeous Johnny is unfortunately too earnest and too patient really to go anywhere in particular, preening like a collection of meticulously cleaned Travis demos or, at their worst, an Adam Green album without any of the dirty bits.","Mar 22, 2005"

Alternative Press,100,"Daft Punk are such stellar, meticulous producers that they make any sound work, even superficially dated ones like spastic early-'80s electro/R&B ('Short Circuit') or faux-orchestral synthesizer baroque ('Veridis Quo').","Mar 22, 2005"

Prefix Magazine,90,"Daft Punk have pulled off a brilliant wheeze by re-inventing the mid-'80s as the coolest pop era ever. And not even the officially approved retro-kitsch cool of Madonna's lukewarm excursions into post-Daft terrain but all the bubble-permed, sports-jacket-and-jeans excesses they can muster.... Mostly, though, 'Discovery' is simply fantastic pop...","Mar 22, 2005"

Rolling Stone,70,"Matching Homework in quirkiness, buoyancy, and club-ready freak-beats, Discovery combines the best of what Daft Punk has to offer: mid-'80s synth-pop ('Digital Love'), sleazy euro-funk ('Harder Better Faster Stronger'), shake-your-booty electro-metal with spacey guitar effects ('Aerodynamic' -- Basement Jaxx meets Eddie Van Halen), and minimal, big-beat tunes that Underworld wishes it would have thought of first ('Superheroes').","Mar 22, 2005"

Pitchfork,70,"Occasionally, as on the gurgling electro-pop of 'Short Circuit,' the album actually manages to disappoint. But more often it provides the kind of intelligently produced yet universally likeable floor-fillers that keep even devoted hipsters from killing themselves when their relatives drag them to suburban dance clubs.","Mar 22, 2005"
AllMusic,70,"Listeners might tire of its mechanical edge, but luckily Daft Punk folds in a few more layers. Whether the listener believes it or not, Discovery postulates that club music can possess depth of sound and be more than a never-ending beat that simply marshals your body along with it. Thus, the songs are shorter, more eclectic and rife with hills and valleys of beat that urge you to stop and listen.","Mar 22, 2005"
PopMatters,64,"In truth, Discovery rarely invokes its predecessor's slap-bass funk, and few other tracks resemble the obviously single-designed 'One More Time.' Instead, Daft Punk focus on fusing mid-80's Kool and the Gang R&B beats with post-millennial prog flourishes and more vocoders than you can shake at Herbie Hancock.","Mar 22, 2005"

Drowned In Sound,52,"Too much of Discovery is relatively run-of-the-mill, lacking the pinpoint punchiness of the pair's debut.","Mar 22, 2005"
Mojo,30,"While Discovery embraces the cheesiness of the lamest of lame music, the strategy frequently comes across as gimmickry. The album isn't so much fun as it is silly, and while Daft Punk's members may just be musical smart-alecks, funk hasn't sounded this resoundingly stupid since Bootsy Collins' squiggly solo work.","Mar 22, 2005"

AllMusic,70,"Instrumental compositions like the eclectically conceptual 'Patternicity 1' are interesting diversions, but its on the hard-charging 'Dont Hold Back, Feel a Little Longer' where rhythm and airy tonal elements play off one another in steady, galloping contrast, and the breezy, swinging 'Vessels of a Donor Look 2' that the band comes closest to pop economy.","Mar 22, 2005"

Drowned In Sound,50,"A primary-color blast of major-key melodies, airy boy-girl vocals, ringing guitars, skipping rhythms, brass, woodwinds, and rolling piano, the rather exhaustingly charming third album from this Canadian collective radiates with the earnest warmth of a child's finger painting.","Mar 22, 2005"

Drowned In Sound,70,"For fans of some of Brodericks earlier material, then, these qualities, combined with the relatively narrow range of instrumentation and short duration of the album, may prove somewhat limiting and not as immediately immersive as some of his best work.","Mar 22, 2005"
The A.V. Club,67,"It's musical air-freshener at worst, and inspired homage at best. The dance's themes of infirmity and redemption are writ large in the song titles, but it's Broderick's technique, not the narrative, that captivates.","Mar 22, 2005"

Delusions of Adequacy,60,"Fortino may not have hated the world away, but she possesses a similarly intuitive ability to block everything out so she can operate in her own peculiar vacuum.

Entertainment Weekly,90,"Ambitious yet restrained, elegant yet exciting, Veckatimest is an endlessly-rewarding album which seems destined to vie with Animal Collective's Merriweather Post Pavilion for the title of the year's best.","Feb 22, 2005"
The A.V. Club,90,"This is a superb record, a spirted illustration of sepia-tinged Americana that feels linked inextricably with Animal Collective's 'Merriweather Post Pavillion' as one of the not only most hyped, but also finest records of 2009. [Spring 2009, p.66]","Feb 22, 2005"
Drowned In Sound,90,"Really, in a world far too concerned with backstories and far too lacking in good old dedication to craft, Grizzly Bear's just about as boring as they come: four guys who very quietly set out to make a fantastic record. And so they did.","Feb 22, 2005"
The Boston Phoenix,90,"All bets arent necessarily off in terms of whether or not Grizzly Bear have hit their plateau--recall that we did this with 'Yellow House' in 2006; oops--but its hard to imagine them giving us more to enjoy in one sweeping statement than they have here.","Feb 22, 2005"

Paste Magazine,80,"With such songs as 'Southern Point,' which builds from shuffling, folk-jazz grooves into a squelchy, winding fairytale, breathtaking piano-pop anthem 'Two Weeks' and the towering drama of 'I Live with You,' we join the consensus: this is a record to swoon over.","Feb 22, 2005"

Observer Music Monthly,60,"On Veckatimest, by contrast, the experimentation can go over the top: the additional arrangements may not add much aside from being one more thing to admire. And, paradoxically, doing that moves some songs out of the avant-garde and squarely into the middle of the road.","Feb 22, 2005"

AllMusic,80,"It doesnt hurt that theyve made their most pleasing record yet.

Pitchfork,70,"It's a fair guess that he has a workshop full of chorus, flange, and delay pedals from that era at his disposal, considering that every instrument and vocal line is run through one effect or another, making most of the album unintelligible or indecipherable, but it's just that limitless, everything-including-the-kitchen-sink way of working that makes Blank Dogs so special and interesting.","Feb 22, 2005"

Rather, it plays to the Intelligence's extremes, casting a more pronounced British Invasion pop influence in warped, peak-level lo-fi sonics, emphasizing a connection between post-punk and psychedelia that stretches from Clinic and Guided by Voices through the deconstructionist pop of Swell Maps and Wire and back to the whimsical wordsmithery of Syd Barrett and Skip Spence.","Feb 22, 2005"

New Musical Express (NME),60,"Although Romanian Names drops the terrorism fixation, it does attempt to make the most of the other moves that its predecessors did, but to diminishing returns. [Spring 2009, p.68]","Feb  8, 2005"
PopMatters,60,"A unique, if impenetrable artists, Vanderslice deserves a wider audience. [Jun 2009, p.132]","Feb  8, 2005"

Under The Radar,88,"Some bands make a third album; others make something more like a third refinement of 'the album.' This feels like the (charmed) latter.","Feb  8, 2005"
AllMusic,80,"Thanks to Monahan and the strength of the songs the trio wrote for the album, this stands as Au Revoir Simone's best work so far.","Feb  8, 2005"
Drowned In Sound,80,"You can slice up its track-by-track constitution--a gently sung, interesting turn of phrase here, an evocative chord progression here--but it is a beautiful, haunting creature as a whole, and a poignant testament to the power of simplicity.","Feb  8, 2005"
Urb,80,"Music to stick pins in voodoo dolls of the popular kids by.","Feb  8, 2005"
Prefix Magazine,80,"The fact that many of the songs have lengthy instrumental passages confirms that Au Revoir Simone is more concerned with conveying emotions than just singing about them. On this count, the album's a clear success.","Feb  8, 2005"
Tiny Mix Tapes,78,"The band's egalitarian and mutually supportive dynamic pays off on the harmonious Still Night, Still Light, their third and best album.","Feb  8, 2005"
PopMatters,70,"Opener 'Another Likely Story' sets the mood, dovetailing chilly lunar textures with hushed vocal harmonies to often nap-worthy effect.","Feb  8, 2005"
Pitchfork,70,"Essentially, Still Night, Still Life is a fun, carefree listen and doesn't pretend to be anything more. As an added bonus, it's also a clear improvement over the band's past works as well.","Feb  8, 2005"
musicOMH.com,70,"Listen to Still Night, Still Light for what it is and its unlikely you will end up disappointed.","Feb  8, 2005"
Observer Music Monthly,70,"Snoozy delights from the polyphonic twee whose outright nerdiness is charming.","Feb  8, 2005"
PopMatters,60,"Everything sounds lovely, but the songs are too indistinct from one another, and theres very little emotional range on display.","Feb  8, 2005"
Pitchfork,60,"There's an intimacy to these songs that makes it feel like you're intruding on some private sorrow, but there's no denying their ability to sustain a mood. [Jun 2009, p.117]","Feb  8, 2005"
Drowned In Sound,60,"There's a couple tunes that rise above the general lo-fi languor. But you get the feeling they could carry on like this, lost in unchanging adolescent reverie, forever. [Jun 2009, p.83]","Feb  8, 2005"
New Musical Express (NME),60,"Au Revoir Simone might want to explore organic instrumentation further--the vocal harmonies would flourish--although the lyrics could wilt in the exposure. [Summer 2009, p.64]","Feb  8, 2005"
PopMatters,40,"Over the course of a whole album their light-as-afeather mix of glacial keyboard, breathy vocals and mid-tempo time signatures begins to grate, and you wish producer Thom Monahan had made them take more risks. [Jun 2009, p.99]","Feb  8, 2005"

Uncut,80,"As two musicians who may have gotten slighted, their self-titled album is an accomplished and impressive debut.","Feb  8, 2005"
Mojo,80,"'Cave Mouth' rocks with something of Fugazi's technical heft, while 'Perfect Fit' matches Penner's quavering vocals to dancing Klezmer piano and swells of cymbal. [Aug 2009, p.88]","Feb  8, 2005"
Q Magazine,75,"The purpose of Clues wasnt to outshine Penner or Reeds past successes, but to make great new music. And on Clues, they do just that.","Feb  8, 2005"
cokemachineglow,72,"Striking stylistic tics like this pop up all over Clues, and the contextualizing effect is undeniable: for good or ill, its nigh impossible to hear this album anew, free from preconceptions.","Feb  8, 2005"
New Musical Express (NME),70,"One hears a variety of influences on this 2009 release, including no wave, psychedelic rock, art rock, 1980s post-punk, Brit-pop, and even folk at times; all of those influences serve Clues well, and all of them add to the intrigue on their promising debut album.","Feb  8, 2005"
Spin,70,"Clues offer precisely that: hints at considerable future potential, and, for any budding gumshoes keen to probe the mysterious fate of The Unicorns, arguably something of smoking gun.","Feb  8, 2005"
Urb,70,"The result is far from flawless, but Clues sparkles in the rough.","Feb  8, 2005"
Dot Music,64,"There may be some excellent tracks on this record, but it mostly hints at better things to come down the line.","Feb  8, 2005"
Prefix Magazine,60,"Yet get past the grating AF-isms and theres some good tunes.","Feb  8, 2005"

AllMusic,70,"There are certainly some succulent dishes on the album ('Xerses' and 'Eats Darkness' for me) but all together I do wonder if someone ordered a bit too much?","Feb  1, 2005"
musicOMH.com,60,"Hes abandoned the tres, a three-stringed Cuban guitar used uniquely on earlier efforts, in favour of a few not-so-good stabs at reggae. But he keeps his songs zippy and focused, and infuses many with foot-tappin playfulness.","Feb  1, 2005"
The Guardian,60,"Apostle Of Hustle have now all but abandoned the Cuban mores of earlier albums in favour of a lean, bass-driven powerpop. [Sep 2009, p.79]","Feb  1, 2005"
Drowned In Sound,59,"As a whole, Eats Darkness feels haphazard in a way that shades into self-indulgence.","Feb  1, 2005"
No Ripcord,58,"Through its ups and downs, Eats Darkness keeps plenty of good ideas circulating. Sometimes the band ties them all together, but not often enough.","Feb  1, 2005"
Mojo,58,"No longer satisfied with the kitchen disposal, Eats Darkness just goes ahead and throws in the kitchen sink, tractor, uprooted tree, and any other incongruous items it can find. [Summer 2009, p.96]","Feb  1, 2005"
Q Magazine,50,"On their third album, the trio largely abandon the Latin influences of earlier outings for a medium-haul flight back to the more two-dimensional sounds of Canadian indie-rock.","Feb  1, 2005"
Uncut,50,"Normally, with a scattered album weighted with highfalutin concerns like this one, Id say their maker needed a stronger or meatier concept.  But here, for better or worse, I wish that Whiteman would stop writing songs about important things and just focus on writing good songs instead.","Feb  1, 2005"
The A.V. Club,40,"A major disappointment. [Summer 2009, p.64]","Feb  1, 2005"

Pitchfork,80,"The songs here all sound very samey. Not to say it's an easy listen. It's a dark one, and many songs lose themselves in sleepy, drawn-out droning. However, extended jams should be nothing new to those well-versed in the Warlocks catalog","Feb  1, 2005"
Slant Magazine,80,"Though no longer flavour of the month in 'cool' circles, as far as The Warlocks are concerned it's business as usual, and The Mirror Explodes is up there with their finest works to date.","Feb  1, 2005"
PopMatters,70,"Hecksher may not have Yorkes falsetto or vast vocal range, but his delivery is sincere, almost as if each word is a plea to understand his expression. Heckshers melancholic state on The Mirror Explodes forces one to sympathize, and ultimately connect with each instrument as its own entity.","Feb  1, 2005"
Under The Radar,65,"Its a noise-rock album you can play without annoying your friends, but it wont aggravate the Tortoise worshipers in your group, either.","Feb  1, 2005"
NOW Magazine,50,"All the riffs, drums, and lyrics seem to struggle against the current of a constant drone, with odd sounds bubbling out of the muddy puddle, yet remaining stagnant, as it were. There is nothing remarkable or striking about this mirrors explosion.","Feb  1, 2005"
Tiny Mix Tapes,40,"No amount of time with the disc, however, will make The Mirror Explodes any less impenetrable. Apparently, Hecksher just likes his music noisy, druggy and slow. And that doesnt make for a listening experience any more compelling than it sounds.","Feb  1, 2005"
AllMusic,34,"Druggy records are never all that good when they don't convey anything about the experience other than the blur. That's not to say you couldn't get swept up in The Mirror Explodes' churn under the right influence, but it's not something to inspire the formation of many new memories.","Feb  1, 2005"

Tiny Mix Tapes,80,"Impressively, then, Nathan Fake has shown he is very much more than a one trick pony, with a bold second album statement that gets more impressive with every listen. We should watch his every move closely.","Jan 31, 2005"
Prefix Magazine,80,"The result is writ large on this brilliant second album, which welds his drifting soundscapes to fractious, rapturous techno.","Jan 31, 2005"
Dusted Magazine,80,"Hard Islands is the nasty business that grabs a hold of your short and curlies and never lets go until your rocks are off.","Jan 31, 2005"
New Musical Express (NME),62,"With only six songs on offer--one of which is a 75-second interlude called 'The Curlew'--it's hard to feel like this is the assertive, confident statement Fake has it in him to make. As a strategic move out from the ghetto of nostalgic IDM Nowheresville, though, it'll suit just fine.","Jan 31, 2005"
Pitchfork,60,"Theres no doubting that sensory sensations offered here can hold the listener, but most likely they'll be enjoyed a helluva lot more while chemically-enhanced; essentially this is not a record designed for home listening.","Jan 31, 2005"
cokemachineglow,60,"Ultimately, it lacks the variety or the startling sonic leaps that would make it essential. Interesting, but no cigar.","Jan 31, 2005"
Los Angeles Times,60,"A few of the Hard productions are among Fakes finest to date, but this release--its short running time aside--works primarily on a collection basis, as if it were two separate EPs gathered for one release and nothing more than that.","Jan 31, 2005"
Rolling Stone,60,"His tunes have taken a tougher, more urban tone, with stand-outs 'The Turtle' and 'Basic Mountain' building to hard edged concrete peaks, drenched in acid Rephlex bleeps. [Jun 2009, p.85]","Jan 31, 2005"
Uncut,60,"Hard Islands is evolution. But some will hanker for Fake's fluffier vintage. [Jun 2009, p.102]","Jan 31, 2005"
musicOMH.com,60,"This impressive follow-up finds him lacing hard-edged techno beats with quirky shifts on tone and texture. [Jun 2009, p.121]","Jan 31, 2005"
Urb,60,"Hard Islands is hardly a wash, just frustratingly short of the sound statement Fake wanted to make.","Jan 31, 2005"

PopMatters,80,"You know everything is going to be OK within seconds of the surging, tidal riffs of Wraithlike, and what follows is simply a fine-tuning of what the Park have done before.","Jan 25, 2005"
Uncut,70,"Embrace Maximo for being smarter than most or just shimmy along. Either works.","Jan 25, 2005"
Pitchfork,70,"Quicken The Heart has allowed Maximo Park to showcase all their strengths, some harder, more distorted anthems, and some gentler, livelier ballads.","Jan 25, 2005"
Paste Magazine,70,"If anything the songs might be less hungry than on their debut and less nimble than its follow-up, but it is sure-footed and firmly directional and they have no trouble reaching the benchmark they'd previously set themselves.","Jan 25, 2005"
musicOMH.com,70,"Throughout the course of Quicken the Heart, Maximo Park prove they still havent rectified their quivering post-punk with the anthems they are concurrently and desperately trying to craft. But despite that conflict, they can still occasionally pull it together long enough to bang out some good ones.","Jan 25, 2005"
New Musical Express (NME),60,"While Quicken the Heart isn't bad, its slide into the nondescript is certainly disappointing.","Jan 25, 2005"
AllMusic,60,"They will remain a formidable live proposition, but Maximo Park's third album has to go down as a disappointment--especially given the band's previous high standards.","Jan 25, 2005"
Austin Chronicle,60,"Quicken the Heart sticks rigidly to their formula of nervy rhythms and angular guitars.","Jan 25, 2005"
Under The Radar,60,"Quicken The Heart represents Maximo Park settling into a rut, albeit an intermittently attractive one.","Jan 25, 2005"
AllMusic,60,"Theres an unshakeable feeling that theyre going through the motions a bit too frequently and that this represents a step backwards for a once fresh and exciting band. Unfortunately, it seems the curse of the third album may have struck again.","Jan 25, 2005"
Spin,60,"There are perky alt-pop nuggests aplenty here, so it's a shame the momentum can't be maintained. [Jun 2009, p.96]","Jan 25, 2005"
Lost At Sea,60,"Essentially, the Hollywood sunshine hasn't changed them. This is probably best, as Smith's eccentricities still elevate Maximo Park above the guitar-pop herd. [Jun 2009, p.128]","Jan 25, 2005"
Pitchfork,60,"There's nothing here as good as 'Nosebleed,' the standout from 2007's 'Our Earthly Pleasures'--but there are still some good points here. [Jun 2009, p.92]","Jan 25, 2005"
Urb,58,"Maximo Parks third LP, Quicken The Heart, is equally reassuring--sometimes to the point of tedium.","Jan 25, 2005"
cokemachineglow,55,"The painstaking introspection here seems to stem from a need to use their success and exposure to deliver some definitive, U2-sized message when really they're so much more relatable when they're awkwardly sorting out their psychological messes on the fly.","Jan 25, 2005"
AllMusic,50,"For an album that so readily cruises along on autopilot, the absence of a satisfying lyrical presence keeps it resolutely sandwiched in the middle of the pile.","Jan 25, 2005"
Dusted Magazine,50,"Maximo Park havent failed with this third LP, not at all--its just that they havent done much of anything.","Jan 25, 2005"
musicOMH.com,50,"Flashes of brilliance remain, but consistency has not yet been achieved. [Summer 2009, p.68]","Jan 25, 2005"
The Guardian,40,"Quicken The Heart, however, goes nowhere new and hardly bests its predecessor.","Jan 25, 2005"
PopMatters,40,"It feels as if Smith is drawing from long-gone, innocent, pre-fame events in his life, but as they recede, his stance becomes more wistful and increasingly confused. The music, unfortunately, follows suit.","Jan 25, 2005"

No Ripcord,80,"Just 22 minutes long, We Be Xuxa doesn't waste time in proving that Mika Miko can expand on their Cali-punk roots without losing what made them vital in the first place.","Jan 25, 2005"
New Musical Express (NME),80,"Its catchy, committed, prehensile punk rock.","Jan 25, 2005"
Uncut,80,"While not as hybrid as Abe Vigoda nor as melodic as Jay Reatard, these women kick out a place in the musical universe through sheer, happy, blasting audacity.","Jan 25, 2005"
PopMatters,70,"Here, as elsewhere, there may be subtext and hidden allusions but the important stuff is bouncing around on the surface.","Jan 25, 2005"
Dot Music,70,"As it clatters into earshot, the most immediately surprising thing about We Be Xuxa is that it sounds pretty much how youd expect it to, ie confused, teenage and drunk.","Jan 25, 2005"
musicOMH.com,65,"For those who like their music brief and stupid-simple (and appreciate the various strains of the punk canon Mika Miko are drawing upon), We Be Xuxa can be plenty of fun.","Jan 25, 2005"
Observer Music Monthly,64,"Xuca keeps the listener at a chasmic distance from anything resembling intensity or urgency.","Jan 25, 2005"
Mojo,63,"Many moments of We Be Xuxa come close to fulfilling the band's Slits-meets-Wipers mania, but much of the record feels so giddily tossed off that one almost wishes for a little sheen.","Jan 25, 2005"
Pitchfork,60,"Their live shows are always explosive fun, but for the first time, the ladies (and their new dude drummer) capture their rowdy energy in a studio.","Jan 25, 2005"
Q Magazine,60,"Songs like 'Turkey Sandwich' are nothing new, exactly, but win out on guts. [Jul 2009, p.91]","Jan 25, 2005"
Delusions of Adequacy,50,"On record it's just a little flat because it's all about energy and despite occasional flourishes, the songs are a bit underwhelming.","Jan 25, 2005"
Entertainment Weekly,50,"No one can deny the Los Angeles group's enthusiasm. However as for Mika Miko's album, their creativity seems numbed by monotonous repetition.","Jan 25, 2005"
