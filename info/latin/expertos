AllMusic,70,"Argentinian punk rockers Los Enanitos Verdes close the album with a squalling 'Traveling Band' that snarls, churns, and nearly goes off the rails. A couple of other selections are less inspiring, but the vast majority of Quiero Creedence makes for a truly fine and original tribute record.","Jul 29, 2016"

The Observer (UK),75,"As Plantas Que Curam provides an interesting contrast--making us realise they've chilled-out and don't seem as interested in frantic neo-psych as they seemed to be in 2013. Manual is mature, engaging, and will prove to be--I believe--much more durable in its relevance to Boogarins' musical heritage.","Oct 30, 2015"

Uncut,80,"Slick guest artists Tyga and Kid Ink help the listener bridge the gap between the album's maverick moments and the sweet songs aimed at teens, and with smooth-voiced Royce showing equal grace with love and lust, Double Vision becomes the great and infectious model for a 2015 pan-global pop album.","Jul 24, 2015"

Rolling Stone,60,"As such a unique style of music in their field, there is no reference point to compare Mariachi El Bronx to, but if youve enjoyed I and II, or you want to hear something a bit different then Mariachi El Bronx III is well worth a listen.","Nov  4, 2014"

Under The Radar,37,"Predictable and flavorless, these songs seem to realize a fear that unfairly gathered around Shakira in 2009 when her album 'She Wolf' led some critics to suspect that the Colombian-born star was attempting to Americanize her sound (or had been coerced into doing so by forces in the music industry).","Mar 25, 2014"

Blurt Magazine,60,"Though Sex and Love tries hard to walk the tightrope between the personas displayed on Iglesias' two previous outings, he leans more to the club side here. Your feelings about the album will depend on which side of the divide you lean toward.","Mar 18, 2014"

Blurt Magazine,60,"Vocally, he's less an MC than a greeter or a party promoter--and everyone on the planet is on his guest list.","Nov 19, 2012"
Under The Radar,50,"Ultimately, Pitbull sounds like a slave to the beat, while rhymes become an afterthought.","Nov 19, 2012"
Mojo,50,"The sources wouldn't matter if Pitbull added much to them. But he's not budging from the formula of his million-selling 2011 album, 'Planet Pit.'","Nov 19, 2012"
Rolling Stone,45,"From the dance beats to the cross-pollination of guest artists to the old pop samples, Global Warming is a big dumb album that feels so calculated and market-tested that it is not much fun to listen to.","Nov 19, 2012"
NOW Magazine,40,"Sadly, as Pit forges ahead in his campaign for world domination, his artistry is what's really being colonized.","Nov 19, 2012"

Los Angeles Times,90,"Solidarity is a straight up funky, raucous, dancefloor-troubling, riot-provoking monster of an album.","Sep 18, 2012"
AllMusic,80,"Their music is always exciting, soulful, and expertly played; they never fall prey to world fusion clichs.","Sep 18, 2012"
Under The Radar,80,"The ten songs of Solidarity draw from a huge variety of old music, but the Souljazz Orchestra always knows how to make a simple staccato speak with immediacy.","Sep 18, 2012"
New Musical Express (NME),60,"It all hangs together well, and is ably supported by the band's superb musicianship. [Nov 2012, p.87]","Sep 18, 2012"


PopMatters,90,"All three parties are at the top of their game  Russell is in complete control of her formidable voice, Quantic is in the most verdant part of his career, and the Combo Barbaro? Well, they've been dope for years. The result is a triumph.","Jan 24, 2012"

CMJ,80,"A brilliant album.","Jan 24, 2012"
Consequence of Sound,80,"It is, as you'd expect, expertly played  but there's a vividness to Look Around the Corner that reaches some way beyond mere chops. It's an exceptional collaboration that proves there's life in the old soul yet.","Jan 24, 2012"
Austin Chronicle,80,"To drag out a well worn clich, The Best of Quantic is the proverbial embarrassment of riches, but boy is that true. This is just a feast of plenty for anyone interested at all in smart, sophisticated, well conceived and recorded global music in the 21st century.","Jan 24, 2012"
Entertainment Weekly,80,"As musical hybrids go, it's a fascinating and highly addictive one. [May 2012, p.93]","Jan 24, 2012"
AllMusic,70,"Russell's powerhouse voice is not used to best advantage on the lightly dancing Latin-soul grooves that are Quantic's strength, and so on a number of tracks it sounds as if she's a racehorse being kept to a trot. That's not enough to keep this from being a very good album, but it prevents it from being a great one.","Jan 24, 2012"

AllMusic,72,"It's an enjoyable album, and the playing is astoundingly good.","Aug  2, 2011"
PopMatters,70,"Here they are in sonic competition with a dense mix of world-class musicians, making the overall result great, but washing out the instrumental singularity that they are known for.","Aug  2, 2011"
Mojo,70,"As an Afro-Cuban record, it's solid.","Aug  2, 2011"

Uncut,60,"They're still best when the basic Paco Pena influences surface. [Feb 2012, p.94]","Aug  2, 2011"
PopMatters,60,"Their sense of adventure seemingly knows no bounds, yet when, after six leisurely minutes of jazz-rock noodling, 11.11 suddenly segues into a passage of Cuban folk singing backed by a lone drummer, the strong whiff of pretension might hang rather too heavy in the air for some tastes.","Aug  2, 2011"

AllMusic,60,"This album will infuriate many but bewitch some.","Aug  2, 2011"

Q Magazine,50,"It's a nice project that might have been put to better use as a one night only concert, because it's certainly not the crucial next step in the continued evolution of this otherwise fascinating duo.","Aug  2, 2011"

DIY Magazine,90,"Purists may, of course, have their qualms, but it would be hard to deny the combination of reverence, proficiency, and sheer exuberance in evidence here -- indeed, it's difficult to imagine any serious limits of this band's appeal.","Jun 28, 2011"
AllMusic,80,"It can be no surprise that the group's second effort in this style is a triumph of both authenticity and quality, of fine songs and tasteful playing. [3 Sep 2011, p.51]","Jun 28, 2011"
The Independent on Sunday (UK),80,"Combined with playing that soars so majestically from this band's fingers, the end result is a set that is both unusual yet immediate. If you only buy one album this month, in the opinion of these ears, this should be it.","Jun 28, 2011"

Mojo,90,"Red Hot + Rio 2 takes some time to absorb, but it's sure to tide you over until the next Red Hot compilation is released.","May  9, 2011"
BBC Music,80,"Every collaboration sounds downright elated, and the cross-cultural derangement of tropicalia easily shines through these 21st-century revamps.","May  9, 2011"
Clash Music,80,"The 33 cuts on this sprawling collection offer so many fine and unusual moments, Red Hot + Rio 2 is every bit as unique and groundbreaking, puzzling and dazzling, as its predecessor; only more so.","May  9, 2011"
The Observer (UK),80,"The sheer quality that Red Hot + Rio 2 maintains over the course of its two discs and 33 tracks makes this a very noteworthy effort.","May  9, 2011"
Uncut,80,"Other tracks, like the kinetic breakbeat jam 'A Cidade,' by DJ Dolores with Gogol Bordello's Eugene Hutz, take the Tropiclia spirit into the 21st century, where it sounds perfectly at home.","May  9, 2011"
Drowned In Sound,72,"Some of it will be a little too out-there for some people, and some of it will be a little too harmless for others. But overall, it's an interesting assemblage of artists, and the music is good, covering just enough ground that you can feel the variety but no one's likely to be overwhelmed.","May  9, 2011"

No Ripcord,80,"Pretty electro-pop with jagged edges, and a lingering mood of sumptuous disorientation. [Aug 2011, p.87]","Mar 29, 2011"
Sputnikmusic,80,"The impeccably hip credentials of HN's Roberto Carlos Lange are rather at odds with the wonderfully gloopy Latin-cheese of this Spanish language, old school synth-session's best tracks.","Mar 29, 2011"
AllMusic,80,"Often Lange is able to transform songs into something worldly and like the title implies, there is a mysterious glean to it. So while Lange continues to flex his many weapons, the black ice cream he's created continues to flourish.","Mar 29, 2011"
Kerrang!,80,"It's the unexpected emotions that Canta Lechuza can unearth that stand as its greatest achievement. Lange's most complex compositions here make fascinating art from contrasting moods, and it's that complexity that, ultimately, make this album worthy of return.","Mar 29, 2011"
BBC Music,80,"Mysterious and subtly beguiling, Canta Lechuza begs to be listened to in the condition in which it was made: solitude.","Mar 29, 2011"
Alternative Press,70,"At times doubts can surface as to whether it can fully work but against not inconsiderable odds he ultimately manages to pull it off, delivering on the whole an impressively irregular album of Latin-inflected laptop folk.","Mar 29, 2011"
PopMatters,69,"Lange is clearly in the mood to experiment, letting more traditional instruments take a backseat while he fiddles with electronic equipment, peppering nearly every track with whirs, burrs, clicks, and clacks. He occasionally takes time to build distinct grooves from all these little pieces ('Cenar en La Manana'), but more often than not, his fiddling is distracting.","Mar 29, 2011"
Rock Sound,60,"Canta Lechuza deflates its ambition by bleeping and whirring in every direction at once, landing in a confused heap of awkward samba jangle and rippling steel drums, a curious and compelling mess.","Mar 29, 2011"
New Musical Express (NME),50,"The darker, lilting tones of Oreja De Arena work better, but this album still sounds confused. As a result, its overall impact is diminished.","Mar 29, 2011"

Consequence of Sound,80,"Rockpango is the most satisfying recording that Los Lonely Boys have come up with yet. It confirms the notion that the Garza brothers know exactly what they want and how to get it, with a sound that is inviting, infectious, and inventive.","Feb  1, 2011"
Q Magazine,80,"The 11 songs on Rockpango show the brothers are not only masters of their art but have a comfort level in their maturing sound that allows them to expand it without losing its essence.","Feb  1, 2011"
Billboard.com,67,"In the seemingly throwaway Tex-Mex bump and grind of 'Baby Girl' resides the heart of Rockpango, low-rider rock as eternal as quitting time, while Henry's steel sway and Austin's Tosca String Quartet on 'Change the World' pave the way for Jojo's flawless vocals, a rich wood grain of cantina soul that glides into the guitarist's fiery detailing.","Feb  1, 2011"
The New York Times,60,"It was rich vocal harmonies and deft musical playing that drew us to Los Lonely Boys in 2004, not ambitious or over reaching songwriting skills. And on Rockpango, Los Lonely Boys are sticking with what got them this far.","Feb  1, 2011"
AllMusic,48,"The bad news: Los Lonely Boys are much better players than they are songwriters.","Feb  1, 2011"
Consequence of Sound,40,"Their latest is a rudderless band's reach for roots and realism.","Feb  1, 2011"

Rolling Stone,93,"Martin largely shuns easy romanticism for more assertive messages that celebrate liberation and diversity, themes that can be associated with his coming out last year.","Jan 18, 2011"
Pitchfork,80,"On this album his usual exhortations to seize life's pleasures mingle with coming-out manifestos, and he smiles through them all.","Jan 18, 2011"
Uncut,63,"Martin rarely transcends the narrow parameters of commercial Latin music, but the sincerity of his vision places him one step ahead of the competition.","Jan 18, 2011"
The Independent on Sunday (UK),60,"Theoretically, this loosening of expectations would give him some freedom to roam on Musica + Alma + Sexo, and it does to the extent that he does not feel compelled to devote the record to the English language.","Jan 18, 2011"

Delusions of Adequacy,80,"Recorded partly in Senegal with contributions from Youssou N'Dour and Orchestra Baobab, the good hearted energy of this second album announces him as a potentially major figure to watch.","Jul 15, 2008"
Dusted Magazine,80,"The result is an album that veers between lilting, languid songs like the title track, and sudden bursts of energy and anger, as on Yurumei, a lament about the horrors of the slavery days in which fuzz guitar is mixed with Garifuna percussion, Latin riffs and sturdy vocal work from the Garifuna women's chorus. This promises to be one of the albums of the year.","Jul 15, 2008"
AllMusic,80,"Listen to this album three or four times in quick succession and you'll hear something different each time; it's difficult to imagine growing tired of it.","Jul 15, 2008"
musicOMH.com,80,"In lesser hands, such 'fusion' elements could have fallen flat, but Aurelio's obvious talent, and Duran's sterling musical arrangements, instead yield an impressive album that simply sounds better which each new listening.","Jul 15, 2008"
Pitchfork,80,"It successfully establishes an effective common ground between the musical traditions of Africa and the Caribbean. It's also a sweet, appealing and vibrant set delivered with a satisfying combination of energy and sensitivity.","Jul 15, 2008"
New Musical Express (NME),78,"Martinez may not be able to right the wrongs of the past, but he does Palacio's legacy proud on Laru Beya. And by bringing this music to a world stage, he may also help secure his people's cultural future.","Jul 15, 2008"
Clash Music,70,"Listeners will probably compare Laru Beya to Watina--the croon and swing of punta and parada are back-but the Senegalese connection helps make this album into something on its own terms, more layered, a little less raw.","Jul 15, 2008"
AllMusic,50,"Honduran Aurelio takes the Garifuna mantle from his late, great mentor Andy Palacio (ACL Music Festival 2007), further evolving the musical moment an African slave ship broke free to the Caribbean.","Jul 15, 2008"

American Songwriter,100,"Sale el Sol still demonstrates Shakira's boldly global mindset.","Apr  3, 2007"
Austin Chronicle,91,"Sale el Sol manages to bridge the divide between the old and new Shakira with a spark that keeps you listening to the very end.","Apr  3, 2007"
PopMatters,90,"Sale el Sol never once sounds disparate or overworked -- it's sunny and easy, its natural buoyancy disguising Shakira's range and skill -- but listen closely and it becomes apparent that nobody makes better pop records in the new millennium than she does.","Apr  3, 2007"
Paste Magazine,80,"The album isn't as heady as She Wolf, but there's an easy charm to how Shakira deftly navigates such a mash of genres.","Apr  3, 2007"
Rolling Stone,70,"Mostly, her new album is businesslike, serious, sane.","Apr  3, 2007"

Billboard.com,90,"It's when the ceaseless forward momentum of old hijacks Pop Negro's new structural nous that the most rewarding moments arrive here, the aforementioned Soca Del Eclipse, Ghetto Facil and Muerte Midi highlights of an album that's among the year's best, and that, while immediately enchanting, will take years to unravel.","Mar 27, 2007"
The New York Times,80,"El Guincho dons his best Animal Collective costume on his third full-length, an album filled with Afrobeat and tropical rhythms. Yet it doesn't sound derivative in the least.","Mar 27, 2007"
Los Angeles Times,80,"Most of the time, though, the convulsive beats are enough to shake you from your slumber and move you from your present position, slouched in a computer chair, to reinstate you with some much-needed kinetic drive.  God bless any album that can do that, let alone that does it consistently and with so much complexity as this one.","Mar 27, 2007"
AllMusic,80,"Combining afrobeat, dub and more samba slickness than you can shake a headdress at, the frenzied carnival rhythms of Pop Negro will spark a fire in your newly tropical soul that will still be smoldering come next year's Mardi Gras.","Mar 27, 2007"
The Telegraph (UK),80,"It is broad in its appeal, yes, but it is miles deep in its longevity.","Mar 27, 2007"
The Guardian,80,"He'll probably still be relegated to afternoon festival slots and in hard to find reaches of your local record store, but Pop Negro is another delightful record that pushes the boundaries between music and countries.","Mar 27, 2007"
AllMusic,70,"Pop Negro is just as impressive as the debut was. It's just that the indie landscape has shifted so much over that time span that someone blending all sorts of African, Latin, dance, and pop elements and influences into a whirling, glittery disco ball of sound isn't exactly enough to stop the presses.","Mar 27, 2007"
BBC Music,70,"There's a strong undercurrent of entrancing, psychedlic-pop to enjoy if you're prepared to listen hard enough. But if you're not into that sort of thing, if you're all about the tunes and the beats, it's still worth a go--I doubt it'll set your world on fire, though.","Mar 27, 2007"
musicOMH.com,61,"Pop Negro feels transitional. El Guincho has a clear abundance of talent; he simply didn't harness it this time around.","Mar 27, 2007"
Pitchfork,60,"It feels like an artist distancing himself from his direct influences. [Fall 2010, p.67]","Mar 27, 2007"
PopMatters,60,"Much of the experimentation is on the surface, and there does not seem to be a great deal of further depth or sophistication. Often, it is all too bright and too relentlessly ecstatic to feel truly meaningful or substantial.","Mar 27, 2007"
Austin Chronicle,60,"Though the title hints at darker turns, the album never steps out of the glare.","Mar 27, 2007"
Entertainment Weekly,50,"The high points of Pop Negro are where Diaz-Reixa is at his most celebratory and unrestrained and moments like the vocal hooks in 'Ghetto Facil' and the stop-start pounding of 'FM Tan Sexy' prove it. Unfortunately, the exuberance that bursts out of the clutter of his best songs is a characteristic seen too rarely here.","Mar 27, 2007"

Billboard.com,90,"Light a Candle is a rhythmic and refreshing soundtrack to adventures through tropical and summery locales.","Jun  7, 2005"
AllMusic,60,"With a somewhat re-jiggered lineup, they pick up the thread of that release with the follow-up, Light a Candle.","Jun  7, 2005"
Boston Globe,60,"Some tunes, like the swaying, gentle 'Silence Is Golden,' are merely pleasant. But 'Caipirinha,' a spare cut built primarily on booming percussion, is just fierce.","Jun  7, 2005"
Rolling Stone,60,"Played loud, this is wonderful party music, but the band use old-style forro simply as their starting point.","Jun  7, 2005"
BBC Music,50,"Its pleasant and unessential.","Jun  7, 2005"

CMJ,88,"Despite its disparate influences and multi-handed production approach, All in One never feels less than cohesive.","Mar 13, 2001"
PopMatters,80,"Despite the large cast, All in One is a remarkably unified record; no one makes a larger impact here than Bebel Gilberto herself, while she and executive producer Didie Cunha create a record that's modern in execution but classic in its feel.","Mar 13, 2001"
New Musical Express (NME),80,"The set features several strongly tropical numbers, like the gentle 'Cancao de Amor' and a fine cover of her father's original bossa nova classic 'Bim Bom.'","Mar 13, 2001"
No Ripcord,60,"All In One is instead a contented album by a contented woman, a series of shared moments that may not challenge but will not offend either.","Mar 13, 2001"
Prefix Magazine,40,"Here the daughter of bossa nova creator Joao Gilberto has made an album that either drowns in its own sensuousness and sentimentality.","Mar 13, 2001"

AllMusic,90,"With simple, straightforward songs that appeal to melodic sensibilities rather than rhythmic contraptions, the set is a mix of vulnerability and earnestness.","Sep 12, 2000"
Drowned In Sound,80,"It says quite a bit about Nelly Furtado's ambitions and skill when her Spanish detour winds up being arguably her strongest album yet.","Sep 12, 2000"
Pitchfork,80,"The music here is lush or spare when necessary. More singing in this context makes her shine more brightly.","Sep 12, 2000"
