Drowned In Sound,70,"Despite its obvious ingredients and well-worn criterion, Brutalist Bricks comes off peculiarly fresh.

BBC Music,70,"Leo has now produced more Pharmacists records while we've been at war than not, and in a world that still needs Fugazi's oppositional fire, The Brutalist Bricks' Dischordant burn is welcome.","Feb 23, 2010"
AllMusic,70,"Although it may not be a punk album through and through, songs like 'The Stick' and 'Where Was My Brain?' embody the genre's spirit with pounding drums, frenzied guitars and rushed deliveries (the former cut clocks in at less than two minutes), while 'Mourning in America' mixes the genre's chaotic arrangements and political bite with Leo's usual power-pop flare.","Feb 23, 2010"

Pitchfork,60,"His social commentaries occasionally overwhelm the music, as on Bottled In Cork, a doozy that might elicit an I get it, I get it, the world is fucked response.

Drowned In Sound,60,"With its return to a more straight-forward approach, This Addiction does hark back to the likes of Goddamnit and Maybe Ill Catch Fire. Unfortunately, while not being a bad album, it is not a patch on those seminal earlier releases. Simply a solid recycling of their much-loved sound.","Feb  2, 2010"

Absolute Punk (Staff reviews),60,"While it is by no means required listening, Couple Tracks is certainly worth it for newcomers and short-time fans of an up and coming experimental punk band.

AllMusic,91,"On My Dinosaur Life, the Minneapolis quintet's winning fourth album (ably produced by blink-182's Mark Hoppus), frontguy Justin Pierre lets his geek flag fly, likening a breakup to the destruction of Superman's home world and puzzling over ephemera ranging from acid rain to Busta Rhymes, all backed by soaring choruses guaranteed to fossilize themselves into your brain.","Nov  3, 2009"

Pitchfork,80,"On his third album, Bemis has crafted one of his strongest musical statements yet, outright mocking genre conventions one second before deliberately succumbing to them the next, showcasing large amounts of self-referential humor but never once stopping to point out just how clever he is and feeding into what could potentially be a Kanye-sized ego.","Oct 20, 2009"

The A.V.
