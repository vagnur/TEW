The Telegraph (UK),80,"At its best, Born in the Echoes is gloriously disorienting, restoring a woozy mania to a genre in danger of self-combusting in search of ever more euphoric pop highs.

Spin,70,"The 14-track effort staggers in its breadth, especially since the album never loses its central through line: his knack for spinning pretty, heavy, and pretty heavy tracks.","Jun 16, 2015"
AllMusic,70,"A relatively disjointed assembly of tracks seemingly drawn from working folders labeled like 'athletic anthems,' 'theatrical intros and interludes,' 'almost pop,' 'space ballads,' and 'misc.'","Jun 16, 2015"
Resident Advisor,66,"When Lantern hits its high points, it ends up somewhere in the stratosphere. When it falters, it's mostly because it's too ambitious, either thematically, as with the overblown love songs, or technically, as with the roller-coaster sequencing that halts the momentum over and over.","Jun 16, 2015"
NOW Magazine,60,"The problem is that Birchard spreads himself so thin in his rush to tick off all the stylistic boxes, some songs sputter into half-realized clich.","Jun 16, 2015"

Rolling Stone,60,"The monster beat shell games of 'Scud Books' and 'Portrait of Luci' show why his jams are a hip-hop gold standard. The vocal takes impress less decisively.","Jun 16, 2015"
The Observer (UK),60,"Although Lantern strains more than a few sinews, trying to show everything Mohawke can do (sensitive soul remakes, apocalyptic digitals) theres room for raw touches such as Lil Djembe, which recall the trap beats that made HudMos name.","Jun 16, 2015"
Clash Music,50,"We really want to like Lantern for its originality; its bravery and its attempt to grasp a genuine uninhibited euphoria that isn't easy pull off. Sadly it just misses the mark way too often and leaves you with fleeting glimpses of what could have been a very exciting album.","Jun 16, 2015"
Magnet,40,"Even as it completely eschews Mohawke's maximalist, hyperkinetic style of old for a newfound soft side, Lantern registers as a limp, populist gesture for how ham-fistedly it attempts to reconcile the two. [No. 122, p.57]","Jun 16, 2015"

Pitchfork,75,"Hurricane is classic Jones.","Sep  6, 2011"
Consequence of Sound,70,"All in all, Hurricane is a worthy collection of music for Jones at this point of her career; we should hope it's the start of a new era for the icon rather than just a one-off release.","Sep  6, 2011"
New Musical Express (NME),70,"In revisiting the production of her '80s records she paradoxically produces something that sounds timeless.","Sep  6, 2011"
Dot Music,70,"While never as life-changing as these memories clearly were, Hurricane succeeds in its sheer force of conviction.","Sep  6, 2011"
AllMusic,60,"Although Guest's interpretations work well as an accompaniment piece, it's the return-to-form original (also included here in its entirety) which remains the more essential listen.","Sep  6, 2011"
PopMatters,60,"It's good enough to warrant the inevitable 'return to form' and 'comeback' labels, good enough to make you appreciate Jones all over again. Take a step back, though, and it is far from perfect. At times it escapes embarrassment by the skin of its teeth.","Sep  6, 2011"

Prefix Magazine,70,"While the frequent use of echo and the isolation of each instrument lend the record a spare quality, Strange Weather, Isn't It? is hardly akin to Bowie and Eno's emotionally stark Berlin Trilogy.

AllMusic,70,"Higher Than the Eiffel is most reminiscent of the work that Freestylers and Lo-Fidelity Allstars were doing eight to ten years ago.

PopMatters,70,"In general, though, when the Bullys have their sights set on the dancefloor, whether it be a drug fueled downer house anthem or a colossal electro groove, they seem most at home.

Drowned In Sound,60,"Resultantly, while the textures are nostalgic, the album is a very contemporary experience. Since you're unlikely to ever get the same 20 plus artists on the same page again, it's best to enjoy the album for what it is: a one-off experiment, more of a happening than a record, that can't (and possibly shouldn't) be repeated.","May 11, 2010"

PopMatters,40,"Animal is a techno record trying to be New Order, but it tries to do so with a small palette of raw synths and the antiseptic tenor of Cox. It neither displays the vaunted pathos of New Order nor much in the way of sonic experimentation to give the listener something to munch on since the lyrics are nothing much either.","Mar 30, 2010"

Los Angeles Times,75,"Ke$ha's tipsy lilt allows her to effortlessly shift from half-singing to half-talking, a technique that makes her vocals carom like shiny pinballs against the crazy beats and sound effects that make up these tracks. She never gets bogged down or sounds like she's trying too hard.","Nov 23, 2009"
The Boston Phoenix,75,"Animal is a clear subversion of pop norms amid a sea of synth stabbing and whisky guzzling, a kick in the groin on a dark dance floor.","Nov 23, 2009"
Billboard.com,66,"Animal teems with choruses that stick with the listener for days, from the blissful 'Your Love Is My Drug' to the catty 'Backstabber.'

Spin,60,"It's comforting to learn that Lady Gaga's supposed dark side--The Fame Monster offers a flipside to The Fame's sexy fun--is just as fun-loving and club-rousing as the songs that made her famous, because, really, her playful faade is a huge part of her appeal.","Nov 17, 2009"

The Guardian,80,"Ultraviolet certainly doesn't sound like the work of the salvation of female rap: if anything, it's at its least successful the closer it gets to straightforward hip-hop.

Pitchfork,75,"Night Music's rawness--Jaumet even manages to make a saxophone, that treacly emblem of kitschy synth-pop cocktail bar culture--sound visceral and disturbing on 'At the Crack of Dawn'--is what separates the album from the glut of 80s jackers.","Oct 27, 2009"
AllMusic,70,"It's striking stuff--definitely not easy listening, but well worth the effort, even if it feels like a slightly lopsided affair, with the final four tracks overshadowed by one terrifically effective and truly inventive epic.","Oct 27, 2009"
Dusted Magazine,70,"With Carl Craig producing, Jaumet offers a fittingly stripped-down suite of tense, stomach-churning tracks. Dappled with oily synth slicks, frittered timbres and blacklight radiance, it can be a heavy listen.","Oct 27, 2009"

Mojo,80,"A dizzying series of minimalist Afro-psych mantras, Ay Ay Ay interlaces eccentric pounding beats, multitrack boom-tsch hiccups, and nervy fragmented vocals, building a groove that crackles with the rhythmic perversity of Arthur Russell's strangest sound experiments but drives on like a reborn TV On The Radio who've learnt to lose it down the disco.

PopMatters,80,"Kill careens from pop rock to cheesy metal to variations on funk throughout its duration, propelled by the energetic imagination and musicianship of the band like an all too phallic torpedo.  Electric Six is still a juggernaut to admire, so buckle up and ride the lightning.","Oct 20, 2009"
AllMusic,70,"This darker, heavier tone makes the majority of Kill less of a party than 'Fire' or 'I Shall Exterminate Everything Around Me That Restricts Me from Being the Master,' but splendidly, Dance Commander rears his head to make demands like 'Shake that tambourine/Shake that shaking machine!' in 'Egyptian Cowboy' and encourages mass consumption in the splendid 'Body Shot,' which devolves from a grunge-disco jam into a wonderful, dubbed-out frenzy.","Oct 20, 2009"
Slant Magazine,70,"While the album lacks a certain degree of accessibility and thematic coherence, Electric Six's wiseass humor and, moreover, their superior technical skill make Kill an energetic, frenzied party of a record.","Oct 20, 2009"

AllMusic,80,"There's no way around the fact that most of Machine Dreams is icy electro-pop, but it is not as if the truly singular Yukimi Nagano, an enamoring vocalist, has switched to drone mode, forsaking her grounding in R&B.","Oct  6, 2009"
Pitchfork,77,"The album falters slightly when the music becomes more abstract and inscrutable, but on the whole it is not difficult to relate to Nagano or slip into the mood created by her bandmates.","Oct  6, 2009"

Spin,70,"With nods to synth pop, electro, and funk, Sweden's Little Dragon fill their second album with bleeping keyboards and jazzy arpeggios, recalling both Howard Jones and Saint Etienne.

Village Voice,70,"Its good, and I dont mean just because it reminds me of Mass Effects soundtrack but on the terms of a record: it ingratiates and ebbs and even exasperates, at a stretch, before rewarding in the end.","Nov  4, 2008"
Billboard,70,"e Kranky audience is likely to find the work here to be a charming retrospective. Newcomers should approach Reinhardts stuff as a pretty gateway to an era whose ideas continue to fertilize todays pop.","Nov  4, 2008"
The Boston Phoenix,60,"Is Jonas Reinhardt successful as a piece of unique art? Absolutely. Is it successful as an album? To be honest, just barely.","Nov  4, 2008"

Slant Magazine,80,"Galore makes for one of the most self-assured, strutting debuts in recent memory.","Oct 28, 2008"
Hartford Courant,70,"Galore the band isn't as distinctive as its influences, and many of the album's songs are so polished and streamlined that there's little chance for Dragonette's personality to shine through. However, their more adventurous side surfaces on the album's second half.","Oct 28, 2008"
Vibe,60,"For the most part, however, this is an ultra-sugary album which leaves a strangely sour aftertaste - not a flavour the public seems too fond of.","Oct 28, 2008"
AllMusic,60,"On their charming debut, the four-piece fulfil their promise of being the edgy, sexually voracious Ace of Bass.","Oct 28, 2008"

The A.V. Club,70,"If the album doesn't always make that point in its words, it consistently makes that point by being as fun a pop record as Pink's albums tend to be.","Oct 28, 2008"
Billboard,70,"Anything that reduces Pink's in-your-face presence, and that includes a preponderance of slowed-down, tarted-up examinations of divorce, is probably an ill-advised move.","Oct 28, 2008"
Boston Globe,70,"Funhouse is more haunting than amusing, but the solidarity that comes along with her recent divorce serves as the effort's muse and proves to be her best partner in life.","Oct 28, 2008"
The Boston Phoenix,70,"Funhouse is a ride, empowered by her post-divorce freedom. In a way, that does make Funhouse unique among divorce albums, as it's the first to concentrate on liberation rather than loss--but if she was going to go in this direction, Pink may have been better off not pretending that she's bothered by the breakup.","Oct 28, 2008"
AllMusic,70,"Perhaps Funhouse is a victim of its own excess: it may be inevitable that an album of 14 songs with more than a dozen credited writers will end up as hit and miss, as messy as this.","Oct 28, 2008"

The Guardian,60,"In the end, Funhouse bites off more than it can chew, but it never chokes on its ambitions: it shows Pink as one who is unsure of her post-marital identity, hopping around from emotion to emotion without ever settling onto a state of stability until the albums well-timed closing moments.","Oct 28, 2008"
Dot Music,50,"Even though Pink oozes disappointment in herself and others, her music mostly fails to keep up.","Oct 28, 2008"
Slant Magazine,50,"Pink can reach unusually stirring heights when in the right register. That register, on Funhouse, is something close to despondence with a lot of tiredness thrown in--just enough to make Pink forego her instinct for winking and simply sound pained instead.","Oct 28, 2008"

Village Voice,67,"Scaled-back tracks like 'Eh, Eh (Nothing Else I Can Say)' and the dreadful 'Brown Eyes' are done no favors by Gaga's limited pipes; luckily, the majority of the album is fueled by a glitter-laced, dance-inciting energy that bodes well for extended club play, which is really the whole point.","Oct 27, 2008"

AllMusic,75,"He makes his many sonic guises come to odd, bouncy life. All of which helps make Welcome the kind of album that sounds more whole after it's been put away for a while, then returned to circulation just to see what sticks in the memory.","Apr 29, 2008"
musicOMH.com,60,"Consistency isn't Pants' strong point, and the latter half of the CD falters with a spattering of sparse instrumentals that feel more like skeletal after-thoughts than fully developed creations. At the grandest moments, Pants accomplishes his mission of re-creating the dance-happy fun funk of Chromeo and Cameo, and the cardboard-spinning electro boogie of Arabian Prince and Egyptian Lover.","Apr 29, 2008"
PopMatters,60,"James Pants may well develop a style or voice of greater substance with future releases. But, as of now, his reliance on his synthesizer aptitude is too repetitive, too flat, and too conventional to convey much meaning or purpose.","Apr 29, 2008"
The A.V. Club,60,"The record could perhaps do with more of these vocal interjections, as it's packed with mostly instrumental grooves.

Spin,50,"It's hard to actually consider Welcome a bad album, mostly because it has this inexplicable likability: It's bizarrely comic without coming across as cheap irony, and it's pretty clear Pants lays down these semi-instrumental jams because he wants to have fun and make noise with some once-expensive, now-dated (and, subsequently, currently underheard) musical machinery.","Apr 29, 2008"

PopMatters,70,"Listeners might tire of its mechanical edge, but luckily Daft Punk folds in a few more layers. Whether the listener believes it or not, Discovery postulates that club music can possess depth of sound and be more than a never-ending beat that simply marshals your body along with it.

Dot Music,64,"In truth, Discovery rarely invokes its predecessor's slap-bass funk, and few other tracks resemble the obviously single-designed 'One More Time.'

On advice from friends the Chemical Brothers, Cook recruited collaborators for the first time -- nu-soul diva Macy Gray, funk legend Bootsy Collins, fellow superstar DJ/producer Roger Sanchez -- and the two tracks with Gray, 'Love Life' and 'Demons,' are arguably the highlights of the entire album.","Oct  3, 2000"
Dot Music,80,"Vigorous and wise, this is dance music for grown-ups, with Cook keenly aware that any number of spritely garage and trance chancers have stepped in while he's been away making babies.

Urb,80,"And though his search for dance-floor transcendence gives the album emotional heft as well as a sense of pacing, the best songs on Halfway are the ones that look straight into the gutter and dive right in, corny catchphrases and all. 'Ya Mama' -- which will likely do for 'Push the tempo' what 'The Rockafeller Skank' did for 'the funk soul brother' -- is sped-up, silly, and, in the end, one of the more memorable songs on the album.

Mojo,70,"Fans of 'Praise You''s twisted but hooky soul or the beat-box bonanza 'The Rockafeller Skank' may be a bit disappointed with this current collection. Not because the record is a thundering and cohesive example of sequencers used for good instead of evil, but because Fatboy's approach this go around is a lot less (new-) user friendly.

AllMusic,60,"Slim's Halfway only reaches heaven twice (Macy Gray's two star turns), and otherwise trolls, not in a gutter, but in what feels like interminable traffic. Most of Halfway's songs extend past the five minute mark, and like a movie that hasn't felt the firming up of a good editor's hands, they feel way too long.

Rolling Stone,60,"He's ditched dusty folk LPs for guest appearances by stars such as Bootsy Collins and Macy Gray. Gentrification suits him.

The Fatboy Slim assembly-line music machine is in full effect, and anyone looking for substance needn't bother. But to call this collection of sweet nothings half-assed would imply that there was much going on to begin with: The disc is business as usual, a big load of disposable fun and funk that's fluffier than cotton candy and just as weighty.","Oct  3, 2000"

AllMusic,50,"A halfway successful attempt by Cook to stake his claim as Serious Artist.... Cook started work on Halfway feeling paralyzed by the problem of how to bypass big beat's exhausted fastbreaks-acidriffs-oldskoolsamples formula. He found his path by partially abandoning breakbeats in favor of house's hypnotic four-to-the-floor, and by bringing in what he's called an 'almost gospelly' flavor.... It's surprising, though, how much dated, big-beat-style pummel you have to endure before the almost gospel vibe's glorious return.","Oct  3, 2000"

Select,83,"Working from a crate stuffed with quality cuts that blur the lines between trance, techno, and tribal house, Oakenfold deliberately showcases selections that err on the melancholy or contemplative side... Contrasted against the sometimes formulaic feel of Oakenfold's other comps, this is a stellar reminder of why he's remained a superstar for so long in a genre that's notorious for its short attention span.","Sep 12, 2000"
AllMusic,70,"With unexpected juxtapositions learned from hip-hop and a sense of spiritual release gleaned from underground disco, Oakenfold steers the ultra-European, classical-minded pulse of trance toward syncopated rhythms, drum-free interludes and actual songs.","Sep 12, 2000"
Mojo,60,"Throughout the mix, Oakenfold follows the proven formula of prefacing more beat-heavy, climactic tracks -- such as Max Graham's 'Airtight' and Tone Depth's 'Majestic' -- with otherworldly vocals-only tracks by Dead Can Dance and Sabel, among others.
