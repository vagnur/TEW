PopMatters,80,"Yes, the references are abundant--in an homage, they're supposed to be. Wobble employs them with a curator's taste; his skill as a bandleader creates space for disparate tongues to communicate before evolving into a different musical language--his own. Everything Is NoThing is a monster.""Oct  7, 2016"
AllMusic,80,"Producer Youth has described the record as Wobbles Miles Davis opus and while thats maybe a mite fanciful, its certainly a courageous contemporary fusion of afro-beat, jazz and polyrhythmic funk.""Oct  7, 2016"

AllMusic,80,"There are certainly lulls among the 18 tracks, moments of randomness, and even an occasional lack of direction. But if Cline is indeed trying to conjure a feeling of romance through instrumental jazz, he's done just that on this record.""Jun 17, 2016"
American Songwriter,76,"Almost half of the first CD is made up of Cline originals, and these pale a bit in comparison with the surrounding material. Though thanks to its sly and measured embrace of the experimental, Lovers still has all the originality it needs to endear.""Jun 17, 2016"
Austin Chronicle,75,"Lovers is, simultaneously, Nels Clines most ambitious and most straightforward project.""Jun 17, 2016"

The New York Times,70,"Lovers is a departure for Wilco guitar swami Nels Cline, whose side projects generally involve free-jazz freakouts.

The Guardian,65,"IV is perhaps a little too ambitious for its own good. Grandiose aims are never to be scoffed at, but considering that IV's highs are so remarkably high and its lows are so forgettable, one cannot help but wish that BBNG had smoothed out the product.""May 20, 2016"
The Observer (UK),60,"Five years on, BBNG stand poised to write jazz standards for the next generation. In some circles, youd call that progress. But for folks that turned to BBNG as infiltrators, rebels, the razor edge of the new--in those circles, youd call that a sell-out.""May 20, 2016"

Record Collector,80,"Bismillah and Karam add gentle layers of spiritual jazz and afrobeat to the mix.

The Observer (UK),69,"Jackie Lynns only significant weakness is that, even though individual songs benefit from brevity, the record is too short. Its eight tracks take up only 22 minutes, and two of those tracks are micro-length instrumentals; its half an album at most.""Jan 22, 2016"
AllMusic,60,"The album does demand great attention. I cant imagine any of these songs playing on the radio, or on one or two listens attracting new fans. Stalwarts of Circuit des Yeux and Haley Fohr will likely delight, however, in this new installment of her performance art.""Jan 22, 2016"

Tiny Mix Tapes,90,"Every song sounds earned, not just by life but by musical wisdom. Each track may cannily remind us of great music from the past, but the core of each song is original.

The Observer (UK),80,"The swinging, jazz-country arangements are perfect, too, hitching the polished, romantic sophistication of the songs to a down-home, rootsy bonhomie that draws comparison with Dylan's reinterpretations of the Sinatra songbook on 2015's Shadows In the Night.

Pitchfork,80,"Just as you think the trio are going to lock up legs and topple over, they fall into a gorgeous minor-key stride and dissipate into a sweepingly ominous mid-song bass solo.

Clash Music,70,"To be sure, it's a jazz album, as much about tradition as expanding it, informed by Coltranes (John and Alice), Miles Davis fusions, bebop and more; yet it's clearly shaped by crate-digger funk and film scores, hip-hop collage and gospel.""Mar 27, 2012"

PopMatters,80,"Recorded live with no overdubs or loops, Never were the way she was is a perfect blend of Neufeld's violin virtuosity and Stetson's outside-the-box approach to saxophone and clarinet, their styles complementing yet pushing each other to new heights.""Mar 13, 2012"
The Guardian,80,"Never Were The Way She Was is stunning, understated and poignant, evoking isolation and yearning for some unnamed thing. Despite some less successful detours, it's a monster of a journey that calls to mind a windswept, brutal white North fraught with life.""Mar 13, 2012"

Drowned In Sound,70,"The focus is therefore narrower, and while Stetson doesn't reach the same heights of grandiose menace as on his previous album, the results are roundly impressive, rooted to the continuing spectacle of two discrete approaches melting into one another, each disrupting and perverting the effect of the other.""Mar 13, 2012"

AllMusic,50,"There's no doubt that Skee-Dat-De-Dat...Spirit of Satch is a project of love, but by the closing stages there's no getting away from it; the album is a bit of a... drag.""Sep 29, 2009"

Rolling Stone,80,"Even though 52-minute long Enter! feels very much like one multifaceted composition, it has been awkwardly divided into two parts.

AllMusic,60,"The music and lyrics might be a bit overheated for those who favour feints and ambiguities, but the mix of funky keys-and-guitar vamps, ripping free-sax howls, avant-pop vocals (Simon Ohlsson is a pretty good Bowie clone), and Bley-like harmony-clouds in which reeds and low brass soar and burrowis often awesomely powerful.""Jul 21, 2009"

The Guardian,80,"With sharp production and some of the better compositions Phish have managed in ages, Fuego ranks among their best studio albums, capturing strands of the frenetic, cartoonish, darkly cautionary, and open-hearted expressions that make their concerts such moving experiences, but which often get lost when the tape starts rolling.""May 15, 2007"

American Songwriter,90,"Whilst the band's previous two releases, 2009's Sensible Shoes and 2011's Bring Your Own, both showed progression in this direction and were wonderful in their own right, TPIYN outdoes them both and pretty much everyone else currently making this kind of music.""Sep 19, 2006"

Mojo,80,"This whole album feels less of an art stunt and more of a well-executed idea.""Jun  8, 2004"
NOW Magazine,80,"A thoroughly decent album from start to finish.""Jun  8, 2004"
Exclaim,75,"Despite it being a visionary work from an artist seldom seen nowadays, The Big Dream is more cohesive, more coherent but all the less fearless because of it.""Jun  8, 2004"
Boston Globe,74,"The Big Dream, like so much of his output, seems gloriously unbothered by chronology or even sense of place.""Jun  8, 2004"
AllMusic,70,"Its more of an unconscious escape hatch that Lynch has constructed with intangible aural elements--a fantasy place that he allows us to walk around in for a while until we are forced back into the realm of the painfully awake.""Jun  8, 2004"
PopMatters,70,"At the very least, the album should convince diehard Lynch fans that the directors self-imposed, semi-retirement from filmmaking is bearing some very interesting artistic fruit indeed.""Jun  8, 2004"
Los Angeles Times,70,"Theres enough musical ambition, heartbreak and menace on The Big Dream to keep the Lynch nerds absorbed.""Jun  8, 2004"
Clash Music,70,"More tightly structured and confident than 2011s Crazy Clown Time in terms of narrative, theres further clarity in the unmistakable voice, which though heavily filtered feels much closer to his own.""Jun  8, 2004"
Q Magazine,70,"Even if his take on the blues is far from straightforward, this might be the most accessible set of songs associated with Lynch to date. In its own hypnotic way, The Big Dream honors the blues' lust for life and its lonely heart.""Jun  8, 2004"
Record Collector,70,"It continues one of the most singular artistic visions of modern times and while it may not push it any further its often so damn charming as to make you forget about all that and just drift away into Lynchs meditative world, in wrong love with the weird.""Jun  8, 2004"
The Line of Best Fit,70,"An intriguing album befitting of a fascinating man.""Jun  8, 2004"
The Quietus,67,"Over the course of the records 12 tracks, Lynch settles into an electro-blues groove as comfortable and consistent as hes likely to get as a musician.""Jun  8, 2004"
The Wire,63,"The main weakness is the same one found on Crazy Clown Time: the songs. As songs, they dont do much or say much.""Jun  8, 2004"
Mojo,60,"A follow-up that's both more consistent and more predictable. [Sep 2013, p.104]""Jun  8, 2004"
The New York Times,60,"Its an album of spare and precise beauty, and when it was over I really wanted to see the film.""Jun  8, 2004"
Spin,60,"This is an unrelentingly difficult record, with all semblances of pop music and even melody eschewed for a Hound of the Baskervilles trudge through a gothic swamp.""Jun  8, 2004"
Tiny Mix Tapes,60,"Its uncertain music from an uncertain man, an artifact that will continue to influence growing pains from the many Lynchian dreamers.""Jun  8, 2004"
Uncut,60,"Lynch showcases a grim neighbourhood that seems electrically oppressed somehow, synthesised echoes murmuring like residual radiation.""Jun  8, 2004"
Mojo,50,"The Big Dream is but a pretty stone that withers the moment it is touched, lifted for further inspection.""Jun  8, 2004"
musicOMH.com,50,"What's here feels a bit decaffeinated, downbeat Moby-ish electronica over which Lynch speaks or sings in a shaky blues croon. [Sep 2013, p.91]""Jun  8, 2004"
The Guardian,50,"With a few more such thoughtfully crafted moments The Big Dream might have been an entirely adequate sidenote in Lynchs ever-growing oeuvre. As it stands, it is barely that.""Jun  8, 2004"
The Independent on Sunday (UK),50,"The Big Dream is vaguely interesting, but not very interesting.""Jun  8, 2004"
Fact Magazine (UK),50,"Lynch may be devoting much of his time and passion to his new career as a musician, but The Big Dream still has a thin, larky feel, briefly amusing, consistently strange, but rarely resonant.""Jun  8, 2004"
AllMusic,40,"The mood darkens further here--Lynch's croon is mired deeper in dirgey, junkyard blues--and it's harder work too, which rather militates against the carefully crafted unease.""Jun  8, 2004"
The Quietus,40,"It's a sound with all flesh stripped off the bone, but Lynch himself sounds like an intellectual playing bogus trailer-trash.""Jun  8, 2004"
Resident Advisor,30,"A series of one-dimensional tracks, produced by Dean Hurley, that at their best sound like a karaoke outsider artist running though some vocal exercises. [Aug 2013, p.54]""Jun  8, 2004"

XLR8r,80,"A great deal of care has gone into the record.""Jun  8, 2004"
Sputnikmusic,80,"All of which helps to make That's It! a vibrant, engaging work and one of Preservation Hall's best albums.""Jun  8, 2004"
The Independent on Sunday (UK),70,"Thats It! is no radical departure, sonically speaking. Will these songs stand the test of time? Maybe, maybe not; but they sound pretty good right now.""Jun  8, 2004"
AllMusic,70,"Theres nothing timid about the bands break from tradition here. True, with eleven new tunes, the Preservation Hall Jazz Band arent exactly preserving anything. But if all goes well, these tunes will be worth preserving 50 years from now.""Jun  8, 2004"
The Guardian,70,"The band manages a set that subtly plays with history.""Jun  8, 2004"
Mojo,60,"A fine outing that's less 'preservation' than extension.""Jun  8, 2004"

AllMusic,90,"Its compelling stuff; we need more musicians who are prepared to go nuts in this delightfully joyous way.""Feb 17, 2004"
The Guardian,80,"Theres enough raucous obnoxiousness, not to mention effortless expert musicianship, in these eight tracks and thirty-five minutes to mark Melt Yourself Down out be the front-runner for not just that token Mercury nod, but the ironic moustache twiddling party album of the year.""Feb 17, 2004"
The Independent on Sunday (UK),80,"North African rhythms are an inspiration, and vocalist Gaya's bellowings in French, Creole and personal gibberish also give the band much of its helldriving character.""Feb 17, 2004"
Paste Magazine,80,"Melt Yourself Down is an exhilarating debut from a group whose members know each other well enough to head into this kind of wild territory with nothing holding them back.""Feb 17, 2004"
Boston Globe,80,"The music Melt Yourself Down make on this eight song, 36-minute debut album is insanely full of energy and ideas, a tumultuous barrage of snaky, infectious hooks and punishingly addictive grooves.""Feb 17, 2004"
The Guardian,80,"The collectives strength lies in their snakelike energy: all coiled muscle, hypnotic sway and dangerous unpredictability. The flaw is that it can all get a bit lairy.""Feb 17, 2004"
musicOMH.com,80,"The result is a pulsating, itchily funky brew, pitched somewhere between Pigbag and Can. [Jul 2013, p.78]""Feb 17, 2004"
The Line of Best Fit,64,"Though repetitive, the record is consistently engaging, with plenty of distinct highlights.""Feb 17, 2004"
Filter,50,"This debut feels far too uncoordinated, un-moderated and incoherent to do more than dazzle and confuse in equal proportions before leaving the listener to make sense of what just happened.""Feb 17, 2004"
